    "The scrupulous among you may notice that there are more episodes than there are \"titles\" listed in Wikipedia. You would be correct! The final two episodes of every season are grouped together in Wikipedia because they share a name (and are treated as two parts of the same plot). Normally this would be cause for concern since we would need our transcripts to line up with the titles that we are using to iterate through episodes with. However, we're in luck: such transcripts are grouped together in Lostpedia as well! Therefore, accidentally, everything lines up. (Regarding how to assign ratings to these combined episode pairings, we will simply take the average of the two episodes' ratings.)\n",
