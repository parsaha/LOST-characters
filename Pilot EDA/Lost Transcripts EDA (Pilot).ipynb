And so it ripped open. And the nerves just spilled out of her like angel hair pasta, spinal fluid flowing out of her and I … And the terror was just so … crazy. So real. And I knew I had to deal with it. (He's crying). So I just made a choice. I'd let the fear in, let it take over, let it do its thing, but only for five seconds, that's all I was going to give it.

While working on my [IMDb project](https://github.com/parsaha/imdb/tree/master), I had realized too late that I had overlooked the existence of a [Python package](https://cinemagoer.github.io/) for the purpose of pulling data from IMDb. However, as of the writing of this notebook, it appears to be easier to simply scrape the scores using Beautiful Soup than attempt to parse `Cinemagoer`'s sparse documentation. (I even considered resorting to [PyMovieDb](https://pypi.org/project/PyMovieDb/#description), but it did not have the ratings per episode that we need.)\n",
