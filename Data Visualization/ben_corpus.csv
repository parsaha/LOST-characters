BEN, You never made soup for me.
BEN," Good, it's what we wanted."
BEN, How?!
BEN, I'm thinking. How quickly can you put together a team?
BEN," Then don't waste time talking to us.  Hey Colleen, I want that boat."
BEN," Hello, Jack.  You know what's crazy, Jack? A week ago, you and I were in exactly the opposite situation. I was the one locked up and you were the one coming in for visits. And I know that you were angry that I lied to you about who I was; but, hell, do you blame me? I mean, let's face it, if I had told you I was one of those people that you and your friends have been calling Others all this time it would have been right back to Sayid and his -- fists. Wouldn't it?"
BEN," I want for you to change your at--perspective. And, the first step in doing that would be for me to be decent enough to introduce myself honestly, so --  Hi, my name is Benjamin Linus and I've lived on this island all my life.  You're not going to shake? "
BEN," Bring it in, please. "
BEN, They're fine; and they're close. That's all I'm able to tell you right now. 
BEN," Fair enough. It's all I want to tell you. I'm going to make this really simple, Jack. If you cooperate; we send you home."
BEN," When the time is right, I'll tell you..."
BEN," Patience, Jack. Patience."
BEN, Yes.
BEN," Yes, Jack, why would we be here?"
BEN," Your flight crashed on September 22nd, 2004. Today is November 29th. That means you've been on our island for 69 days. Yes, we do have contact with the outside world, Jack. That's how we know that during those 69 days your fellow Americans re-elected George W. Bush; Christopher Reeve has passed away; the Boston Red Sox won the World Series.  What? "
BEN," No, they were down 3 games to none against the Yankees in the league championship, and then they won 8 straight. "
BEN," That's home, Jack. Right there, on the other side of that glass. And if you listen to me -- if you trust me -- if you do what I tell you when the time comes -- I'll take you there. I will take you home."
BEN," Juliet, I need you."
BEN," The sub is back. We have a situation, so come with me now."
BEN, What do you weigh?
BEN, What do you weigh?
BEN,  How old are you?
BEN, Don't lie.
BEN,  Good.
BEN, We turned it off.
BEN, Juliet's taking care of her.
BEN, Jason.
BEN, It's for the pain.
BEN," God, I hate needles."
BEN, Shhh.
BEN,"  Hey. Hey, come on. Hey, move. Let's move. Hey, come on, come on, come on."
BEN,"  Come on, come on, come on, come on. Let's move it. Let's move it. Let's move it. Hippity-hop. Hippity-hop. Hippity-hop."
BEN, Let's move it. Let's move it. Let's move it. Let's move it.
BEN," Come on, come on, come on."
BEN, You know what a pacemaker is?
BEN," They stick them in the tickers of people who've had by-pass work whose hearts need just a little jump -- a kickstart. The rabbit had a small pacemaker set to deliver its kickstart should it get too excited, or anxious, or frightened -- or should it try to escape.  Assuming you were telling the truth about your age and weight your resting heart rate should be about 70 beats per minute. Your active heart rate, however, that would be about 140 -- which is the point at which your pacemaker will cause your heart to explode. Which is how I know that you're going to start behaving now. The watch monitors your pulse. If you get within 15 beats of your danger zone it'll start to beep. If and when it beeps, you're going to want to relax yourself. Do some deep breathing, some yoga."
BEN," Because we're not killers, James. Oh, and one other thing -- Kate..."
BEN," You tell her what we did, what we put in you -- that we're watching you -- you tell her any of these things -- we'll put one in her, too."
BEN, Have you lost your mind? You bring him here?
BEN," Well, this is not why..."
BEN, Danny can wait.
BEN," No, I want him to sit with her for a while longer."
BEN, Good morning. Let's go for a walk.
BEN," Not much further, James -- just at the top of the next rise."
BEN, Something I want you to see.
BEN, Sorry?
BEN," Your heart's not going to blow up, James. The only thing we put inside you was doubt. Oh, the watch is a heart rate monitor, but nothing more.  Look. We gave him a sedative, not a pacemaker."
BEN, You don't.
BEN, The rabbit wasn't the thing I wanted to show you.
BEN, You ever been to Alcatraz -- take the tour? Right now you're standing on a small island roughly twice the size of Alcatraz. And that over there -- that's your island -- the one you've come to know and love. I just wanted you to know there's nowhere to run.
BEN," We did all this because the only way to gain a con man's respect is to con him. And you're pretty good, Sawyer. We're a lot better. Funny thing is, us telling you about the pacemaker wasn't what kept you in line. It was when I threatened her. You work so hard to make her think you don't care -- that you don't need her, but, ""A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody. It don't make no difference who the guy is, long as he's with you. I tell you, I tell you a guy gets too lonely and he gets sick."""
BEN," It's from Of Mice and Men. Don't you read? Come on, let's get you back to your cage."
BEN," Good evening, Jack. "
BEN, I was hoping you might join me for a walk.  What? 
BEN, Then don't say no. Why don't you put this on.  I'll wait outside. 
BEN, Sorry? 
BEN," Why are you asking me these questions, Jack? "
BEN, I have no idea what you're talking about. 
BEN, Stay here. 
BEN,"  As we prepare to send Colleen on her way, I'd like to take a moment... "
BEN,  Why did you show him my x-rays? 
BEN, I'd like to talk to him. 
BEN, Alone. Please. 
BEN," And I'm thrilled that you're fine, Jack, but it's private. Doctor-patient confidentiality. "
BEN," We had such a wonderful plan to break you, Jack.  "
BEN, Wear you down till you were convinced we weren't your enemies. Get you to trust us. And then of course we'd lead you to believe that you were choosing to do... whatever we asked you to do. All of this of course assumed that you would get... invested. 
BEN, Has it not occurred to you that Juliet bears a striking resemblance to your ex-wife? 
BEN," I'm telling you this, Jack, because my wonderful plan... got shot to sunshine when you saw my damned x-rays and figured out I was dying. "
BEN," No, I want you to want to save my life. But we're beyond that now, so... all I can ask is that you think about it.  Do you believe in God, Jack? "
BEN," Two days after I found out I had a fatal tumor on my spine, a spinal surgeon fell out of the sky. And if that's not proof of God, I don't know what is. "
BEN,  Oh.
BEN," Alright, then. Whatever you need, it's yours. I'm ready."
BEN," Well, Jack. I'm very disappointed in your decision. "
BEN, Get her out of there.
BEN," If it helps, I was surprised, too. "
BEN," If I were a betting man, I would have picked her and you. "
BEN," Well. I suppose this would be the proverbial nail in my coffin, wouldn't it. "
BEN, Sorry?
BEN, Yes. Of course.
BEN, Done.
BEN, Do you get nervous? Before you do surgery? 
BEN," Whatever happens, everything will be very different, won't it?"
BEN, Juliet. Did Alex ask about me?
BEN," Well, see you on the other side.  I'm ready."
BEN," 20, 19... "
BEN,"  Hey, that's not helping anything. Now, could somebody please get Juliet?"
BEN, I know. I've been able to hear you for a few minutes now. It's very clever of you. I should have seen it coming.
BEN," No, but thanks all the same."
BEN," I'd like to speak to Juliet alone, please, Jack."
BEN," Please, I'm asking you one gentleman to another. It won't hurt you to give me three minutes, will it? Knowing I have only 27 left?"
BEN," The cavalry has arrived, at last."
BEN," We had an excellent surgeon, Jack. His name was Ethan."
BEN, Your bedside manner leaves something to be desired.
BEN, Am I?
BEN," And, here we go again. I've already given you a ticket off this island, Jack. What's it going to cost me this time?"
BEN," Juliet doesn't care about you, Jack. It doesn't matter what she's done. No matter what you think -- she's one of us."
BEN,  Does Isabel have a walkie?
BEN, Then get me something to write on.
BEN, So how do you feel? 
BEN, Alex?
BEN, John!
BEN," All right. It's all right, John. You don't have to point the gun at me. I can tell you where Jack is."
BEN," I'm not sure what you mean, John. What submarine?"
BEN,"  Alex, don't come in here!"
BEN," Alex, please!"
BEN, What is it?
BEN, Where are they now?
BEN, No. Separate them. I want to know how they found us.
BEN, Let me worry about that. Just go.
BEN, Richard? Wait a minute.
BEN, I want you to bring me the man from Tallahassee.
BEN, Just do it. Now.
BEN," No, John, unfortunately we don't have a code for ""There's a man in my closet with a gun to my daughter's head."" Although we obviously should."
BEN," ...OK. But you should know, John, my daughter currently hates me. So I'm not sure holding me hostage is your best option—"
BEN," Would you mind helping me get into my chair? No tricks, I promise.  I just want some dignity. You of all people should understand what it means to want some dignity."
BEN," Thank you. So tell me, John. How do you expect to pilot our submarine? I mean, it's a complicated piece of machinery. You don't just press ""submerge""."
BEN," What's in the pack, John? If you met Mikhail that means you were in the communications station. Which means you found the explosives. So you're not planning to pilot the submarine anywhere, are you? You're planning to destroy it. I know you, John Locke."
BEN," I know you were born in California. I know you were raised in foster care. I know you wasted a big part of your life in Tustin, pushing papers at a company that manufactured industrial boxes. I know you spent the four years prior to your arrival on this island in a wheelchair. And I know how you ended up in it. Tell me, John. Did it hurt?"
BEN," It wasn't easy, you know. Being in that hatch with you all that time. Knowing you had no business walking around. Knowing I couldn't even ask you about it without telling you who I really was."
BEN,  Was it immediate? It started the moment you got here?
BEN, And you were just walking? The feeling returned right after the crash? That day?
BEN," Are you afraid it'll go away, John? Is that why you want to destroy the submarine? Because you know if you ever leave this island you'll be back in the chair?"
BEN, We have two giant hamsters running in a massive wheel at our secret underground lair...
BEN, There's leftovers in the refrigerator. Help yourself.
BEN, I ate most of the dark meat. Sorry.
BEN,"  I know you think you need to do this, John, but if you blow up my submarine, I have a big problem with my people."
BEN,"  I was born on this island. Not many of my people can say that. Most of them were recruited and brought here and as much as they love this place, as much as they would do anything to defend it, they need to know they can leave if they want to. The sub maintains that illusion."
BEN,"  No! They're here because they want to be here! Some of them are just not ready to make a full... commitment yet. But you, John ... You've already made that commitment."
BEN," And now you have a choice. Because if you stop and if you think, I can show you things. Things I know you want to see very badly. Let me put it so you'll understand. Picture a box. You know something about boxes, don't you, John? What if I told you that somewhere on this island, there's a very large box ... and whatever you imagined, whatever you wanted to be in it, when you opened that box, there it would be. What would you say about that, John?"
BEN,"  Why are you so angry, John?"
BEN," You've been here 80 days, John. I've been here my entire life! So how is it that you think you know this island better than I do?"
BEN, Did you have any problems?
BEN," John, she's done enough. Let me take you."
BEN,"  John, before you go you should know—!  Jack and I made a deal. In less than an hour he's leaving this island on that submarine, and it's a one-way ticket. The anomaly wiped out our communications. We have no way of contacting the outside world. Which means when that sub leaves, it can never come back. So whether you destroy the submarine or whether you let it go, the end result is the same. No one will find this island."
BEN, You don't knock?
BEN," And if I said no, would that stop you from leaving?"
BEN," Your friends are only here to rescue you, but you seem to be doing a good job of rescuing yourself, so... I suppose there's no reason to keep them here."
BEN,  You have my word.
BEN," I'll let them go, just as soon as you've left the island."
BEN,"  Well, I guess this is it."
BEN," Well, John, you've really gone and done it now."
BEN," Uncuff him please, Richard."
BEN," Do you remember earlier, John, when you called me a cheater? When you said I didn't deserve to live on this island? Well get this There I was, shaking hands with Jack, and thinking I'd give almost anything to come up with a way to stop him from leaving... because to let him go would be a sign of weakness, of failure, of defeat. People would see that. They would know it. And that, John, would be the end of me. But to kill him... that would be cheating. Because my people also heard me make a promise, and to break my word... that would be the end of me too. And then you came striding out of the jungle, John, to make my dream come true."
BEN," No, John. I'm going to show you what came out of it."
BEN," When I asked you earlier if it hurt when you suffered your injury, I think you misunderstood me. Seems fairly obvious that when a person's back smashes into a hard surface after being thrown from a building, that that's going to sting a little. But I really wasn't asking about the physical pain."
BEN," No, John. I wanted to know what it felt like when your own father tried to kill you."
BEN," He's the reason you destroyed the submarine, isn't he? You're afraid. You're afraid of him, and this is the one place he can never find you. This is the one place he can never get to."
BEN," I don't know how it happened, but you seem to have some communion with this island, John, and that makes you very, very important. You have no idea what you're talking about, of course, but in time you'll have a better understanding of things. So what do I want? I want to help you, John."
BEN, Because I'm in a wheelchair and you're not. Are you ready to see?
BEN, Who left this open? 
BEN, Have him cover it up with the plane. 
BEN, Yes. 
BEN," No, I can convince him to do it. "
BEN," Same way I get anybody to do anything. I find out what he's emotionally invested in, and I exploit it. "
BEN," No, they need to come to us. "
BEN," Michael, of course. "
BEN," Hello, Dr. Burke. My name is Benjamin Linus.  I'm really looking forward to working with you. Watch your step here. "
BEN, It was Sabine's choice to get pregnant. She knew she was taking a risk. 
BEN, I'm not sure I understand.
BEN," No, you're not taking anybody off the Island."
BEN," Your sister won't be giving birth in three months, Juliet. She'll be dead before then. Her cancer is back. "
BEN," Mikhail. I'm sorry, I should have told you sooner, I just didn't see what good it would do."
BEN," You still can. You can go home, Juliet. Be with her in her final days, or you can stay here and help me with our problem. "
BEN," Because if you do, I will cure your sister's cancer. "
BEN," You've been here for six months. You've done extensive work-ups on all of us, have you seen even a trace of cancer?"
BEN," Jacob said he would take care of it himself. Unless, of course, you don't have faith in him. Every woman on this Island needs you. If you choose to stay, I promise you, we will save Rachel's life. "
BEN, Hi. 
BEN," Of course. I was just finishing Carrie. I still don't know why you picked it, but boy is it depressing— "
BEN, What?
BEN," Well, you just told me I have cancer, Juliet, of course I'm surprised."
BEN, I'm not scared.
BEN," I know what I told you, Juliet—"
BEN,"  No, I did not lie to you!"
BEN,  I don't know.
BEN," It's not going to happen Juliet, but I can promise you that Rachel is fine."
BEN, I did!
BEN," No, Juliet—"
BEN, I told you the truth!
BEN, I gave you my word.
BEN,  No.
BEN," Goodwin. Ethan. There might actually be survivors. And you're one of them, a passenger, you're in shock. Listen, learn, don't get involved. I want lists in three days. Go!  So I guess I'm out of the bookclub?"
BEN, Juliet. Juliet! I was looking for you this morning. You and I need to talk. 
BEN, We have some time. It's important. Take a walk with me.
BEN,  Mikhail? We're here.  He never has his walkie on.
BEN," There's something I need to show you. Mikhail! It's Ben. I'm here with Juliet, we're approaching the house.  Don't shoot us..."
BEN," A plane fell out of the sky, Mikhail. Of course we saw it. What do you have so far?"
BEN, I want detailed files on every single passenger.
BEN, Can we uplink to Richard in Acadia Park please?
BEN,  Yesterday you called me a liar. I was hurt by that.
BEN," Hello, Richard, can you hear me?"
BEN," Notice today's date, this is live. OK, Richard."
BEN," A little over two years ago, to everyone's complete surprise, Rachel's cancer went into complete remission. Shortly after she gave birth to a healthy baby boy. His name is Julian.  OK, thank you Richard. You'll wanna get back here as soon as you can; we may have some new visitors."
BEN," I'm not a liar, Juliet."
BEN," That's not our agreement, you need to stay here until your work is finished."
BEN," Then we'll find more mothers. Who knows, maybe there's even one on that plane."
BEN,  Let's go over it again.
BEN, Let's go over it again. Just to be sure. 
BEN, And if she catches you in the lie?
BEN,  Good. What then?
BEN," We've activated the implant in Claire, she should be symptomatic within the next 48 hours. By the time you get to that camp, you'll have a nice big crisis to solve."
BEN, Pryce is already on his way. He'll hide the case at Ethan's old drop-point. Tell Jack that you can save her. He trusts you... are you alright?
BEN,  See you in a week.
BEN, You tell me. You brought him here.
BEN," I'd be careful about getting too close to him, John."
BEN, I already said. We didn't.
BEN, Be my guest.
BEN, Tom!
BEN," I warned you, John."
BEN," I'm afraid we don't have time to deal with that right now, John. We're leaving first thing in the morning, all of us."
BEN," We're going to a new place. Well, an old place, actually. Would you like to come with us?"
BEN," Good. We're holding Kate a few buildings over from here, maybe you'd like to say goodbye."
BEN," Hello, John. Thanks for coming."
BEN, Juliet is gathering information for us at your former camp. She's determining if any of the women are pregnant. Then we're gonna go in and... take them.
BEN," This is not the first time we've done this, John. Trust me, no one will get hurt."
BEN, Could you pass me that please?
BEN, Thank you.
BEN," I believe I have you to thank for this, John. "
BEN," A week ago I couldn't move my toes. But the minute you showed up, I started to feel pins and needles. And this is only the beginning, John. I can't wait to show you what this Island can do. But unfortunately, you're not ready, John."
BEN," No, John, you're not. You're still crippled by the memories of the man you used to be before you came to this Island. And you'll never be free until you release the hold that your father has over you. Why do you think you brought him here?"
BEN," The magic box is a metaphor, John. I can't show you anything until you can show me that you're ready and willing to be one of us. When people join us here on this Island, they need to make a gesture of free will, of commitment. That's why you're gonna have to kill your father."
BEN," Wake up, John. It's time."
BEN, I know it won't be easy. But the quicker the better.
BEN, John. The hesitation that you're feeling is just the part of you that still feels like he has a perfectly good explanation for stealing your kidney. Throwing you out of an eight-story window. Don't you want to be free from him?
BEN," Don't think, John."
BEN," Let go of him, John."
BEN," You're doing this to yourself. As long as he's still breathing, you'll still be that same sad pathetic little man that was kicked off his walkabout tour because you couldn't walk."
BEN, I'm sorry. He's not who we thought he was.
BEN, We're moving.
BEN," We are not going anywhere, John. You are going to stay behind. You both are going to stay behind."
BEN,"  He's your mess, John. Why would we clean it up?"
BEN, Where would you get a ridiculous idea like that?
BEN," Don't tell me what I can't do, John."
BEN," Well, everyone makes mistakes. We're leaving now. We'll leave a trail, one you can track. And John, unless you're carrying your father's body on your back, don't bother."
BEN," It's a birthday present. Mine just happens to be today. You do remember birthdays, don't you Richard?"
BEN,  What?
BEN,"  I recorded it yesterday, before we left. I thought you already took it!"
BEN, Where's Tom? Tom! Have you seen my recorder?
BEN," I know I promised to tell you everything, John, and I wish it was as simple as me taking out a dusty old book and opening it up."
BEN, But it's not that simple.
BEN," You probably think I'm the leader of this little community, but that's not entirely true. We all answer to someone, John."
BEN, His name is Jacob.
BEN, I can't do that.
BEN, Where are you going?
BEN, Why would Richard take you? He doesn't know where Jacob is.  He doesn't talk to Jacob...
BEN, I do.
BEN, That's right!
BEN," I was born here on this Island. I'm one of the last that was. Most of these people you see—I brought them here. So Jacob talks to me, John. He tells me what to do, trusts me."
BEN, That's right.
BEN," And what might you base that theory on, John?"
BEN, I thought you were dead.
BEN, It's all right.
BEN," He's with us now. Where have you been, Mikhail?"
BEN, What?!
BEN, Where is she now?
BEN, We'll be visiting their camp day after tomorrow. We'll take care of it then.
BEN,"  I'm sorry, I have to deal with this now, John. Our excursion will have to wait."
BEN, Tom? Richard?
BEN," You know, you didn't have to beat Mikhail senseless to make your point, John."
BEN," Something you should know, John, before we go. Whether or not you think he's the Wizard of Oz, I can assure you that Jacob is very, very real. And we're gonna go see him, and he's not gonna like it. In fact, I have a feeling he's going to be very...angry. And that's why my hand was shaking, because this is not a man you go and see. This is a man who summons you."
BEN, Thanks.
BEN, Mom?
BEN, Mom!
BEN, Mom!
BEN," Let's go, John. John!"
BEN," Juliet, it's Ben. I'm sending three teams to extract Kwon the night after tomorrow. We won't have time to run Austen's sample, so if you determine that she or anyone else is pregnant, mark their tents, and we'll take them, too. Good luck."
BEN, Mom..? Mom? Mom! Mom! Mom!
BEN, Are you one of them?
BEN, A hostile.
BEN, Ben.
BEN," I left home, and...I'm looking for my Mom."
BEN, You wouldn't believe me.
BEN, She's dead.
BEN, No. When I was a baby.
BEN, She talked to me.
BEN, That I couldn't come with her. She said it wasn't time yet.
BEN, I don't want to go back there! I hate it there! Take me with you.
BEN, We're here. 
BEN," You'll wanna turn off your flashlight, John."
BEN, Jacob feels the same way about technology as you do.
BEN," Once I open this door, there's no turning back. You sure this is what you want?"
BEN, So be it.  Jacob? I'm here with John Locke. We're coming in now.
BEN," Jacob. This is John. Aren't you going to say hello, John?"
BEN,  I told you he wouldn't.
BEN, You can't see him?
BEN," Jacob! He's sitting right here, in this chair!  Yes, I know, but he insisted."
BEN," You wanted the secrets of the Island?  Well, here they are. This is the man who can answer every single-  I am not. He made me bring him here—do you think that that was my—sorry, may I finish?"
BEN, Excuse me?
BEN,"  Jacob, please, I can't hear him if you're gonna talk over what he's saying—"
BEN, I know there's someone there!
BEN," I'm sorry you feel that way, John. And I'm sorry that you're too limited to see."
BEN, I—I didn't say anything.
BEN,"  That's enough, you've had your fun!"
BEN, That was Jacob.
BEN," What did you hear in there, John? What did Jacob say to you?"
BEN, What are you talking about?
BEN, I'm taking us back another way. I wanted to show you something first.
BEN," You know, John, you're not wrong.  Some of the things I've told you—some of the things I've told everybody—are simply not true. "
BEN," Well, for starters, I wasn't born on this island."
BEN, That's what I wanna show you.
BEN, It's my birthday. I dunno why I keep fooling myself into thinking that one of these years you're actually gonna remember.
BEN, I'd like that.
BEN, Do you really blame me?
BEN, Do you really think it's my fault that she died?
BEN," I don't think that's going to happen, Dad. "
BEN," You know, I've missed her too. Maybe as much as you have. But the difference is, for as long as I can remember, I've had to put up with you. And doing that required a tremendous amount of patience."
BEN," Goodbye, Dad."
BEN," No, leave him out there."
BEN," This is where I came from, John. These are my people. The DHARMA Initiative. They came here seeking harmony, but they couldn't even coexist with the Island's original inhabitants. And when it became clear that one side had to go, one side had to be purged, I did what I had to do. I was one of the people that was smart enough to make sure that I didn't end up in that ditch.  Which makes me considerably smarter than you, John."
BEN, What did Jacob say to you?
BEN," Because you heard him. Now, I need to know what he said."
BEN," John, I'm not going to ask you again. What did he say to you?"
BEN," Well, I certainly hope he helps you, John."
BEN, Just now.
BEN,  Here's your gun back.
BEN, Where's Ryan?
BEN, It's time to get them.
BEN, Jacob wants it to happen now.
BEN, John had an accident. Ryan!
BEN," If you leave right now, how long will it take you to reach their camp?"
BEN, Then you'd better get going.
BEN, Then we'll take all their women. And we'll sort out the ones we need later.
BEN," If any of them are stupid enough to get in your way, kill 'em."
BEN, Hello?
BEN, Why are you breaking radio silence?
BEN," I'm sorry, what?!"
BEN, Who? Which one?
BEN, How did... how does he know about the station?
BEN," All right, sit tight, don't do anything, I'm sending help.  Mikhail, you need to go down to the Looking Glass and find out what Charlie Pace is doing down there. "
BEN," I lied. Mikhail, I need you to go now."
BEN," Ryan, come in. Ryan, are you there?"
BEN, What?
BEN," Gone, gone where?"
BEN, What good news?
BEN, It was Juliet. She betrayed us.
BEN," Just figure out where she is, Tom."
BEN, Who do you have?
BEN, Shoot Kwon.
BEN," If you want them to answer questions, kill Kwon. Do it now."
BEN,  Juliet thought we were coming tomorrow. So why were they waiting for us tonight?
BEN, I heard.
BEN, No. Not yet.
BEN," Not we, Richard, me. You're going to take everyone to the Temple as planned."
BEN, Oh really? And why not?
BEN, They're not all dead.
BEN," Hello, Alex."
BEN," Well, I thought I might go for a walk! See if I can't find Jack and all his friends."
BEN, All right.
BEN," I said all right. In fact, I think it's a good idea. I mean, you do want to see Karl again, don't you?  Get your pack, I'm leaving in 10 minutes."
BEN, I'm going to talk them out of it.
BEN," You have to understand, everything I did, I did for the Island."
BEN," Yes it did. You've always been a loyalist, Mikhail, now I'm asking you to trust me, to trust Jacob who told me to do this."
BEN," Because this Island is under assault by forces stronger than anything it's had to deal with in many many years. And we are meant to protect it, Mikhail, by any means necessary. The jamming was for everyone's security. We are in a serious situation here."
BEN," I made a mistake. I should have told you, and I apologize."
BEN," Mikhail, are you still there?"
BEN," I need you to help me. I need you to help me clean up this mess that I've made. I need you to kill Charlie. Make sure that the jamming mechanism continues to function at all costs. And we can't risk Greta and Bonnie telling the others about what we've done, so you'll have to take care of them too."
BEN," Because if I had, Mikhail, you'd already be dead."
BEN," If we head North, we should get to 'em before they reach the tower."
BEN," I let you come because I'm delivering you to your new family. I let you come because you betrayed me, Alex."
BEN, I didn't want him to get you pregnant. I suppose I overreacted. We better get going.
BEN," Because I can't, Alex."
BEN," Hello, Jack. We need to talk."
BEN,"  Hi, I'm Benjamin, I don't believe we've had the pleasure..."
BEN," Just a moment of your time. To talk, you and me, alone."
BEN," Jack, you've just killed seven of my people, the least you can give me is five minutes."
BEN, Have a seat.
BEN," Not so long ago, Jack, I made a decision, that took the lives of over 40 people in a single day. I'm telling you this because... history is about to repeat itself, right here, right now."
BEN," No Jack, you are."
BEN, The woman you're travelling with. The one who parachuted onto the Island from that helicopter. She's not who she says she is. 
BEN," No, she's not. "
BEN," She's a representative of some people who've been trying to find this Island, Jack. She's one of the bad guys."
BEN," Jack, listen to me. If you phone her boat, every single living person on this Island will be killed. So here's what has to happen. Get that device, the phone she carries with her, and give it me. I will turn around, we'll go back to my people, you will turn around and go back to your people."
BEN, May I have my walkie back?
BEN, There's something you need to hear. Please.
BEN," Thank you. Tom, are you there?"
BEN,"  Your plan killed seven of my people, but the ones that you failed to kill are now holding your friends. Jin, Sayid, Bernard. At gunpoint."
BEN,"  Tom, unless you hear my voice in one minute, shoot all three of them."
BEN," Bring me the phone, Jack."
BEN, Forty seconds.
BEN," Let me ask you something, Jack. Why do you wanna leave the Island? What is it that you so desperately want to get back to? You have no one. Your father's dead, your wife left you, moved on with another man. Can you just not wait to get back to the hospital? Get back to fixing things? It's 20 seconds now. Just get me the phone, Jack."
BEN, Ten seconds. Bring me the phone.
BEN, I'm not bluffing!
BEN, Five. Four. Three...
BEN," I'm so sorry, Jack."
BEN,  Alex. This is your mother.
BEN, Jack! I know you think you're saving your people. But you need to stop this. It's a mistake.
BEN," This'll be your last chance, Jack. I'm telling you, making that call is the beginning of the end."
BEN," Jack, please, you don't know what you're doing!!"
BEN," Do it, John! Shoot him! Do what you need to do—"
BEN, I need you to do me a favor. I need you to take Alex and get as far from here as possible. 
BEN," Listen to me, we don't have time for this. Everyone who stays here is going to die. Now get Alex and get away right now, I don't care where you go, just go, I will not have my daughter—"
BEN, 
BEN, Better call the boat. Tell 'em she's getting a real big bundle of firewood. 
BEN," OK, I probably should have told you that I saw her take the phone, but you beat me up, Jack. I owed you one. "
BEN, Kate took it when she hugged you. 
BEN," She found the right trail too, but you wouldn't listen to her, so I guess she's taken matters into her own hands. But look on the bright side, at least somebody around here knows what the hell they're doing. "
BEN," Well, technically, he didn't kill her, yet. "
BEN," Jack, with your permission, I'd like to go with John."
BEN," Alex. Alex, hey. "
BEN, Something I need to tell you.
BEN,"  Karl! Now, if you're gonna sleep with my daughter, I insist you call me Ben."
BEN," Mind if I ask you a question, James?"
BEN, Why'd you leave Kate behind?
BEN," I know it's not pleasant, but, let's face it, you really don't stand a chance now..."
BEN," James. Look at yourself. Yes, on this Island you're brave, daring, handsome, you're someone, but if you left with them, back in the real-world a low-life scam artist like you could never compete with a first class surgeon. I think Kate was really upset when you made your choice to come with us. Thank god she has Jack there to comfort-"
BEN," James, listen to me! Please!"
BEN," John, listen. I have information that you need. I have answers."
BEN, What?
BEN, I don't know.
BEN," Her name is Charlotte Lewis! Charlotte Staples Lewis. Born July second, nineteen seventy-nine, Essex, England. Parents David and Jeanette. Eldest of three, all girls. She was raised in Bromsgrove. Did her undergraduate studies at Kent. Took her PhD in Cultural Anthropology at Oxford. She's here with two other team members and a pilot. Their names Daniel Faraday, Miles Straume, and Frank Lapidus."
BEN," Your instinct was right, John. These people are a threat, and if you shoot me you'll never know how great a threat they were. Because I know what they're doing here. I know what they want."
BEN," Me, James, they want me."
BEN, Because I have a man on their boat.
BEN, John's looking for somebody to tell him what to do next.
BEN, Well... I guess they're running out of jail space.
BEN," I lost a dollar, you know. "
BEN, I bet John that you wouldn't be stupid enough to fall for your friend as bait.
BEN, I know it's no use having friends you can't trust.
BEN,  I'm thirsty.
BEN, It's a secret.
BEN, Why are you crying? Because it hurts? Or because you were stupid enough to care for her? These people don't deserve our sympathies. Need I remind you what they did the last time you thought with your heart instead of your gun? 
BEN," Do you want to protect your friends or not, Sayid? I have another name for you."
BEN, Good.
BEN, From my own bookshelf.
BEN,  I've already read it. 
BEN,  Why did you move me from the rec room down here?
BEN,"  Where are you keeping your other prisoner? Miles, is it?"
BEN,"  Oh, you don't wanna share. "
BEN,"  I feel for you, John. I really do. You keep hitting dead ends."
BEN,"  You couldn't find the cabin, you can't make contact with Jacob — you're so desperate to figure out what to do next, you're even asking me for help. So here we are, just like old times. Except I'm locked in a different room, and you're more lost than you ever were. "
BEN," Excellent, John! You're evolving! "
BEN, Yes. 
BEN, Yes. 
BEN, You've arranged this meeting so you could blackmail me?
BEN, 3.2? But why not 3.3 or 3.4? 
BEN, What makes you think I have access to that kind of money?
BEN," Your friend Charlotte has seen me, she knows I'm alive."
BEN, My present situation is a little bit restricted. Can that be amended?
BEN, Welcome to your humble abode.
BEN," You're here to help us with some very important research, Juliet. We pulled out all the stops. Two bedrooms, two baths. Washer, dryer. Fresh linens, a well-stocked fridge."
BEN," Oh, and I know you love the opera. You have all the classics on CD."
BEN," Right, of course. But... we want you to feel at home."
BEN, May I?
BEN, Any thought yet on a cause?
BEN," No, I'm fine."
BEN, Rabbit today?
BEN," This didn't have a number on it, did it?"
BEN, So has the revolution begun yet? Or...
BEN," Well, you're the leader now. I know it's a tough position. You have to deal with all those people constantly second-guessing your decisions, and it always starts out so innocently, doesn't it? A question here, a comment there, and then if you're not careful, you find you have a full-blown insurrection on your hands. Believe me, your people are gonna be so angry when they realize you still don't have a plan."
BEN, I always have a plan.
BEN," I can help you, John. We have shared interests... or at least a common enemy."
BEN," Not them. The one they work for. Let me out of here. Give me some semblance of freedom, let me sleep in a bed and eat with utensils, and I give you my word I'll tell you everything you want to know about the person who sent the freighter."
BEN," All right, then. I guess I'll have to show you."
BEN, Goodwin! You see where the tail landed?
BEN," You run, you can make that shore in an hour.  Ethan, get up there to that fuselage. There may actually be survivors, and you're one of 'em — a passenger. You're in shock. Come up with an adequate story if they ask."
BEN," Stay quiet if they don't. Listen, learn, don't get involved. I want lists in three days. Go."
BEN," No tricks, John. We don't even have to leave the living room."
BEN," We have a deal, right?"
BEN,"  If my people still wanted me, John, they would've stormed this camp long ago. It's behind that picture."
BEN, 36-15-28.
BEN, I taped over the game.
BEN, This is Charles Widmore. This is the man whose boat is parked offshore. This is the man that's been trying to find the Island.
BEN, One of my people that had the misfortune to get caught.
BEN," I don't know, but he does."
BEN," John, three months ago in Gainesville, Florida, the Virgin Mary seemed to appear in a patch of mold on the side of an old housing complex. When the word got out, over 5,000 people came to see her face for themselves. You've survived an airline crash on this island. One minute, you're in a wheelchair. The next minute, you're doing jumping jacks. If 5,000 people came out to see a piece of mold, how many people do you think would come here to see you? Charles Widmore wants to exploit this island, and he'll do everything in his power to possess it."
BEN," Everything I know about Charles Widmore is in this file. Some of it's vague, some of it's guesswork, some of it's concrete. But this is everything, and now it's all yours.  I'm sorry I didn't tell you all this sooner. But it was the only bargaining chip I had left."
BEN, Alright. But you might want to sit down.
BEN," Hi. Come on in. Sorry. I have to get this ham out of the oven, or it'll dry out."
BEN, Never better.
BEN," Just you and me. Oh, I guess I should've made that clearer."
BEN, I do indeed.
BEN, I want to thank you for how wonderful you've been with Zack and Emma.
BEN, They'll stop asking in time.
BEN," They're on the list, Juliet."
BEN, Who are we to question who's on the list and who's not?
BEN," ... He's making a case for this woman, Ana Lucia.  He thinks she'd be a valuable member of our society. But between you and me, I don't see it. He feels very passionately about her, almost inappropriately so."
BEN," Goodwin stays where he's at right now, Juliet. There's no reason for him to hurry back, right? But his assignment will be over soon. I promise you."
BEN, What are you reading?
BEN, Hmm. How about that?
BEN, I need you to come with me.
BEN," After our last raid on the tail-section survivors, they ran off, left the beach. I sent Pickett and Tom to track their location, and they came across this. I'm sorry, Juliet."
BEN, We don't know; there weren't any witnesses. I can only assume they found out he wasn't one of them. Guess I should've listened to you.
BEN," What, you mean instead of his wife?"
BEN," ""Why""? You're asking me ""why""? After everything I did to get you here, after everything I've done to keep you here, how can you possibly not understand... that you're mine!"
BEN, Take as much time as you need.
BEN,  See you guys at dinner.
BEN," Because once they have me, their orders are to kill everyone else on the Island."
BEN, It's Michael.
BEN, My spy on the freighter is Michael.
BEN, Alex?
BEN, May I have a word with you?
BEN," I'm sorry, you're just gonna have to listen to a little more."
BEN, This is a map to the Temple.
BEN, It's a sanctuary. It may be the last safe place on this island.
BEN," Well, it wouldn't be a sanctuary if I told everyone, would it? The rest of our people are already there. If you leave now, you can get there in a day and a half."
BEN," Because the Temple's not for them, Karl. It's only for us. These people that are coming — they know who I am, Alex. They're here to capture me. They'll kill anybody that gets in their way. If they knew who you were, that you were my daughter, they would use you to get to me. We don't have much time."
BEN," Yes. But your mother will protect you.  Okay, now go."
BEN," I'm so sorry, Michael, but he's still in New York."
BEN, So I'm afraid you're stuck with me. Michael? Are you still there?
BEN, You actually activated the bomb?
BEN," There are people on your boat who are innocent. They have no idea that the man they work for is a monster, a killer without conscience or a greater purpose. I had to show you the difference between him and me. When I'm at war, I'll do what I need to do to win, but I will not kill innocent people."
BEN," You killed them, Michael. No one asked you to... I don't blame you, Michael. We did have your boy. And what wouldn't a man do for his son?"
BEN," I want you to compile a list of names... every person on your boat. When I call again, you'll give me that list. Then you will disable the radio room you're sitting in. When the crew is disoriented by their lack of communication, you'll take out the engines too. That way, the boat can never get to this island, and your friends will be safe. Will you do that for me, Michael?"
BEN, Then consider yourself one of the good guys.
BEN, Where did you hear that?
BEN," We need to get to the other house. It's easier to fortify, and we'll have better position on the tree lines."
BEN, They're here.
BEN, Hello.
BEN," No, no, no, no. Wait."
BEN, Wait. I can explain. D-do you speak English?
BEN,  Do you speak Arabic? تتكلم  بالعربي؟
BEN,  Do you speak Turkish? Türkçe biliyor musunuz?
BEN, Sure. Sure.
BEN," Ah. Okay. Okay, okay."
BEN,  This...
BEN," Oh, so you do speak English."
BEN,  Yah!
BEN, It's an early warning system.
BEN, Somebody tripped the panic switch at our security fence. That means one of my people's been captured.
BEN, How long did you guys debate amongst yourselves whether or not to ask me why the phone rang?
BEN," Well, so much for our head start."
BEN," Don't bother. They're safe. I sent Rousseau, Alex and Karl away yesterday."
BEN, There's no time!
BEN," It's very important that you survive what's about to happen here, John. So I need you to stay close to me."
BEN, Because the people that are coming won't risk hurting me. You want to live? I'm your best chance.
BEN," That's right, John. I am."
BEN, He's not.
BEN," Good afternoon. I'd like a room, please."
BEN, No. But it's been a while.
BEN," I'm actually a preferred guest. It should be under ""Dean Moriarty."""
BEN," Yes. Um, today's date is..."
BEN,  2005?
BEN, Thank you.
BEN," I think the technical term is ""shock and awe."" They're trying to frighten me into surrendering."
BEN," Because there's only one person that can help us now, and that's Jacob, and we have to go to him together."
BEN," I know, but Hurley does."
BEN," Hugo, you don't want to do that."
BEN," Those people were murdered to make you angry, James. So you'd be more likely to come storming in here and throw me to the wolves."
BEN,  I wouldn't if I were you.
BEN, I'm here to find the man who murdered your wife.
BEN, I came across the Syrian border. It's really not as difficult as you might—
BEN, Your friend Desmond had a boat. Remember? The Elizabeth. I followed a heading to Fiji. Then I chartered a plane.
BEN," You remember the name Charles Widmore, don't you? The man who tried to convince the world that your plane was on the bottom of the ocean?"
BEN, There was a man at her procession. He goes by the name of Ishmael Bakir. He's one of Widmore's men.
BEN," Bakir was last seen five days ago in Los Angeles, caught by a traffic camera, speeding away from the corner of La Brea and Santa Monica."
BEN, I don't know. But they did.
BEN," Well, Miles, sounds like you're not gonna collect your 3.2 million dollars."
BEN, Why would I talk to them?
BEN," Well, then they've badly miscalculated, 'cause every single one of my people is prepared to die in service to this island."
BEN, Hello?
BEN, That's right.
BEN," Yeah, I see you."
BEN," You and I both know that once you have me, there's nothing to stop you from killing everybody else on this island."
BEN," Martin Christopher Keamy — former first sergeant, United States Marine Corps, served with distinction from 1996 to 2001, but since then, you've worked with a number of mercenary organizations, specifically in Uganda. So I know exactly what kind of man you are, Mr. Keamy, and we can dispense with the formalities."
BEN, I'd like to present a counterproposal.
BEN, You and your friends... you turn around. Walk back to your helicopter. You fly away and forget you ever heard of this island.
BEN, Alex... I have this under control. Everything's gonna be okay.
BEN," Okay, listen."
BEN, She's not my daughter.
BEN," I stole her as a baby from an insane woman. She's a pawn, nothing more. She means nothing to me. I'm not coming out of this house. So if you want to kill her, go ahead and do it—"
BEN, He changed the rules.
BEN, My name is Benjamin Linus...
BEN, ...and I need you to take a message to Mr. Widmore for me.
BEN, That should do it.
BEN," We're finished here, Sayid. Turn around and walk away. Mourn your loss. Get on with your life."
BEN," Go home, Sayid. Once you let your grief become anger, it will never go away. I speak from experience. This is my war. It's not yours."
BEN, I'll be in touch.
BEN," Excuse me, James."
BEN," Okay, listen to me very carefully I need all of you to do exactly as I say. In a minute, we have to run from this house as fast as we can. At that moment, when I give the order, I want you to head straight for the tree line."
BEN," No, we want to be as far away from them as possible."
BEN," Okay, outside. Outside now!"
BEN, Head for the trees. I'll catch up with you.
BEN," I have to say good-bye to my daughter, John."
BEN," Thank you, John."
BEN, You can ask Jacob all about it when we go to the cabin.
BEN," He's the man that's gonna tell us what to do next, James."
BEN, Follow me.
BEN, Thank you.
BEN,"  Oh, yes. I'm here to see Mr. and Mrs. Kendrick in 4E."
BEN,  They're expecting me.  Feel free to call up.
BEN," Wake up, Charles."
BEN, Iraq is lovely this time of year. When did you start sleeping with a bottle of scotch by the bed?
BEN, We both know I can't do that.
BEN," I'm here, Charles, because you murdered my daughter."
BEN," No, that's not true."
BEN," I'm here, Charles, to tell you that I'm going to kill your daughter. Penelope, is it? And once she's gone... once she's dead... then you'll understand how I feel. And you'll wish you hadn't changed the rules."
BEN,  But you'll never find it.
BEN," I suppose it is. Sleep tight, Charles."
BEN, I don't know. I've been following him.
BEN, I have no idea where the cabin is. Hugo's the last one who saw it.
BEN," What do you think we should do, John?"
BEN, I used to have dreams.
BEN," Yes, Hugo, I was standing right where you are now when I pulled the trigger. Should have realized at the time that it was pointless, but... I really wasn't thinking clearly."
BEN, I didn't kill them.
BEN," They did wipe them out, Hugo, but it wasn't my decision."
BEN, Their leader's.  
BEN, Not always.
BEN," He actually thinks staying was his idea. Not bad, John. Not bad at all."
BEN, You're certainly not.
BEN," You sure it's gonna be there, John?"
BEN, The cabin—what if it's moved again?
BEN," I was told a lot of things too—that I was chosen, that I was special. Ended up with a tumor on my spine and my daughter's blood all over my hands."
BEN," Those things had to happen to me. That was my destiny. But you'll understand soon enough that there are consequences to being chosen... because, destiny, John, is a fickle bitch."
BEN, I'm not going in there with you. 
BEN," The island wanted me to get sick and it wanted you to get well. My time is over, John. It's yours now."
BEN," Good luck, John."
BEN, Did he tell you what we're supposed to do?
BEN, Well?
BEN," We're going to a place called the Orchid, Hugo."
BEN, It's a greenhouse.
BEN, You heard John. We're going to move the island.
BEN, Very carefully.
BEN, Because doing it is both dangerous and unpredictable. It's a measure of last resort.
BEN," May I have that mirror, please?"
BEN,"  You know, those are 15 years old."
BEN, Communicating.
BEN, Who do you think?  
BEN, All right. Now we can go.
BEN," None of your business, John."
BEN," Yes, I suppose they would."
BEN, I'm working on it.
BEN," May I have the binoculars, please? You might wanna get down lower to the ground."
BEN, Because we're at the Orchid.
BEN," We're waiting, John, because Charles Widmore, the man who's trying to capture me and kill all the rest of you, knows about this place and knows that what we need is inside."
BEN, I wasn't being entirely truthful.
BEN, You need to see this.
BEN, Look over there on the left-hand side. Watch the plants at the back.
BEN, They're already here.
BEN," He's there. Hold on to that for me, will you?"
BEN," Listen to me very carefully, John, because I'm not gonna have time to repeat this. You're gonna go into that greenhouse through that hole there. Once inside, you're gonna turn left. Go about 20 paces until you see a patch of anthuriums on your left. They're in an alcove against the north wall. Face the wall, reach down with your left hand. You'll find a switch that activates the elevator. The elevator takes you down to the actual Orchid station."
BEN, I'm gonna take care of them.
BEN," How many times do I have to tell you, John? I always have a plan."
BEN, My name is Benjamin Linus. I believe you're looking for me.
BEN, Charles Widmore tell you to kill my daughter?
BEN, Uhh!
BEN," Thank you for coming, Richard."
BEN," Could you cut me free, Kate?"
BEN, What was the arrangement?
BEN, Fair enough. The helicopter is yours. You and Sayid have a safe journey back.
BEN, That's it.
BEN, Am I interrupting?
BEN," Nice to see you, too, Jack."
BEN," Couldn't find the Anthuriums, could you?"
BEN, Didn't you tell him?
BEN, Sayid and Kate are waiting for you at the helicopter. I understand that your people from the beach are being brought to the freighter even as we speak.
BEN," I'd love to fill you in on everything you missed, Jack, but you, Hugo, James, you need to get moving. If I were you, I'd want to be on that boat within the hour. Good-bye, Jack.  Let's go."
BEN, Deep.
BEN," No, John, it's not."
BEN, Same things that all the DHARMA stations are for —silly experiments.
BEN," You know what, John?"
BEN, Why don't you watch this very informative video that will answer some of your questions...
BEN, ...and I'll take care of some business.
BEN," If you mean time-travelling bunnies, then yes.  "
BEN, May I have my weapon back?
BEN, You killed my daughter.
BEN, You killed my daughter!
BEN, So?
BEN," That's not my problem, John."
BEN, Not if I find him first.
BEN," ""Why"" what?"
BEN," Well, John, I really wasn't thinking straight. Sometimes... good command decisions get compromised by bad emotional responses."
BEN, I'm sure you're gonna do a much better job of separating the two than I ever did.
BEN," If I were you, I'd duck."
BEN, I better change.
BEN, I'm going somewhere cold.
BEN, You don't need one because you're not going with me.
BEN," No, John, you're not."
BEN," He told you what to do, but he didn't tell you how because he wants me to suffer the consequences."
BEN," Whoever moves the island can never come back. So I'd like you to get on the elevator, John, and go back up. Richard and my people will be waiting 2 miles east of the Orchid."
BEN," Ready, willing and able to share what they know. And then they will follow your every word. Good-bye, John. I'm sorry I made your life so miserable."
BEN," You'll find your way, John. You always do."
BEN," I hope you're happy now, Jacob."
BEN," Hello, Jack."
BEN, Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you. Did he tell you that I was off the island?
BEN, When did you speak to him?
BEN, And Kate?
BEN, And what did he say to you?
BEN," Yes, I heard that you've been flying on passenger planes... hoping that you'd crash. It's dark, Jack, very dark."
BEN, I'm here to tell you that the island won't let you come alone. All of you have to go back.
BEN," Perhaps I can help you with that. This is the way it has to be, Jack. It's the only way. You have to do it together, all of you."
BEN, I have a few ideas.
BEN," Jack... I said, all of you. We're gonna have to bring him, too."
BEN," Why don't you close that up now, Jack? Come on. Let's get him in the van. It's out back."
BEN, We'll worry about that once we pick up Hugo.
BEN, Which should make recruiting him considerably easier than the rest of your friends.
BEN," Oh, that's the spirit."
BEN," It happened because you left, Jack. Now let's get started, shall we?"
BEN," Then we get Sun, Sayid... and Kate, of course."
BEN,"  On the Island... in the Orchid station, below the greenhouse. I told him I was sorry for making his life so miserable, and then he left. So obviously John's visit to you made an impression. What did he say to make you such a believer?"
BEN, Did he tell you what happened to them after the Island moved?
BEN, Then I guess we'll never know.
BEN,  Well... looks like we have a change of plan.
BEN," You looking for your pills, Jack? I flushed them down the toilet."
BEN," Yeah, I figured you were."
BEN, I'm checking out.
BEN," You're going home. And find yourself a suitcase. If there's anything in this life you want, pack it in there... because you're never coming back."
BEN, Good. I'll pick you up in six hours.
BEN, John's casket is outside in a carpet van. I need to move it somewhere safe.
BEN," I'll see you in six hours, Jack."
BEN," No, no Porterhouse. I do, however, have something very important in my van, Jill, and I need you to watch it for me."
BEN, It is.
BEN, Have Gabriel and Jeffrey checked in yet?
BEN, He's with us.
BEN,  Cut the man some slack. He's been through a lot. We all have.
BEN," So keep him safe, Jill. Because if you don't... everything we're about to do... won't matter at all."
BEN,  Hello?
BEN, Who?
BEN," Hello, Hugo."
BEN," Hugo, I know you're in trouble, and I can assure you I've taken care of everything."
BEN, I have a car waiting for us out back. The police didn't see me come in. I can get you out of here.
BEN," I'm taking you to Sayid. He's with Jack. That's why I'm here, Hugo. Jack called me. How else would I know that they're together?"
BEN," In their defense, I'm not an easy person to trust. But they came around when they realized that we all want the same thing."
BEN," To go back to the Island. Come with us, Hugo... and this'll be over. You can stop hiding. You can stop worrying about the stories and the deceptions. If you come with me, you won't ever have to lie again."
BEN, Please. Let me help you.
BEN, Any luck?
BEN, Really?
BEN, I'm having some... difficulties.
BEN," No, no, that's not enough time. I need at least—"
BEN," Look, I lost Reyes tonight. What happens if I can't get them all to come back?"
BEN, Good. You're here. How's Sayid?
BEN," Hello, Sayid."
BEN, Good. I'll go deal with Hugo.
BEN, You have friends in trouble. Let's get them to safety and save the dirty linen for later.
BEN," After you get Kate, meet us at the Long Beach Marina, slip 23. And, Jack — hurry. We're running out of time."
BEN, Can I ask you something? Why'd you take it upon yourself to rescue Hugo?
BEN, You can pull in over here.
BEN, Mr. Norton.
BEN, That's very good news.
BEN," Thank you, Dan."
BEN, That's my lawyer.
BEN," Hello, Kate."
BEN," No, Jack. She's right. It was me. Sorry."
BEN," Because he's not your son, Kate."
BEN," Because he's not your son, Kate."
BEN," I didn't kill your husband, Sun."
BEN," No, I didn't. Neither did anyone else, because he's not dead."
BEN," No, Sun. Jin's still alive, and I can prove it."
BEN, Why don't you put down the gun. No one wants it to go off.
BEN," There's someone—someone here in Los Angeles. Let me take you to them, and I'll show you the proof."
BEN, The same person that's going to show us how to get back to the Island.
BEN," Sayid, where are you going?"
BEN," 30 minutes, Sun. We can be there in 30 minutes. And you’ll have proof—proof that he's alive. Or you can shoot me and never know."
BEN,  I didn't account for traffic.
BEN,"  What I'm doing is helping you! And if you had any idea what I've had to do to keep you safe – to keep your friends safe – then you'd never stop thanking me! You wanna shoot me, then shoot me – but let's get on with it! What's it gonna be?"
BEN, May I?
BEN, Take it.
BEN, John gave it to me.
BEN," That's true, Jack. I went to see him.  Jin gave it to him before he left the Island."
BEN," I don't know. Maybe he never had a chance before he died. I'm sorry I had to bring you here before I gave it to you, Sun. But all those people back on the Island—Jin included—need our help. There is a woman in this church and she can tell us how to get back to your husband. But we're running out of time, Sun. So I need you to decide right now. Will you come with me?"
BEN, I assume the same thing you are.
BEN," Hello, Eloise."
BEN, This is all I could get on short notice.
BEN, This is all I could get on short notice.
BEN," No. No, I didn't."
BEN, She left.
BEN," I have a friend looking after it. I'll pick it up on my way to the airport.  What did she say to you, Jack?"
BEN,"  Thomas the Apostle. When Jesus wanted to return to Judea, knowing that he would probably be murdered there, Thomas said to the others, ""Let us also go, that we might die with him."" But Thomas was not remembered for this bravery. His claim to fame came later... when he refused to acknowledge the resurrection. He just couldn't wrap his mind around it. The story goes... that he needed to touch Jesus' wounds to be convinced."
BEN," Of course he was. We're all convinced sooner or later, Jack. "
BEN," Oh, I made a promise to an old friend of mine—just a loose end that needs tying up. See you at the airport, Jack."
BEN," Hello, Jack. Are you there?"
BEN," Listen, we don't have much time. I've been, uh... sidetracked, and I need you to pick up Locke's body and take it to the airport. The coffin is at Simon's Butcher Shop, corner of Grand and Hayes."
BEN, Just do it. Please.
BEN," Hold up! Wait, please! Thank you for not closing it."
BEN, Thanks.
BEN," Who told you to be here, Hugo?"
BEN," What's that, Jack?"
BEN, Who cares?
BEN," My mother taught me. I can read, Jack, because it beats what you're doing."
BEN, Waiting for something to happen.
BEN," You tell me, Jack. You're the one that got to stay after school with Ms. Hawking."
BEN," No. No, I didn't."
BEN, Why don't you then?
BEN, Is it because you're afraid?
BEN," Afraid that he blames you, that it's your fault he killed himself."
BEN," No, Jack, it wasn't your fault. Let me give you some privacy."
BEN," John, what are you doing?"
BEN," Wait, please. John, stop!"
BEN," I have a man watching Sayid. I'm watching all of them, keeping them safe. When you turned up, he called me."
BEN," John, just calm down."
BEN," Please, let me help—"
BEN, I'm trying to protect you.
BEN," Yes. Yes, I did. But it was only a matter of time before he tried to kill you. I was just trying to get to you, but you drove off and crashed."
BEN, He was working for Charles Widmore. He's extremely dangerous.
BEN," No, John, he used you. He waited till you showed up so that you could help him get to the Island. Charles Widmore is the reason I moved the Island! So that he could never find it again, to keep him away so that you could lead.  You can't do this. If anything happens to you... John, you have no idea how important you are. Let me help you."
BEN," No, John, you're not."
BEN, Jack booked a ticket.
BEN," A plane ticket from Los Angeles to Sydney, tonight. Return trip first thing in the morning. Whatever you said to him, John—it worked. And if you got Jack, you can get the rest of them."
BEN, John... you can't die. You've got too much work to do. We've gotta get you back to that Island so that you can do it.
BEN," Please, John. Come on."
BEN, Come down.
BEN," I know we can do this, John."
BEN, You haven't even been to Sun yet. Let's start with her.
BEN, Jin is alive?
BEN, All right.
BEN, A promise is a promise.
BEN, You're welcome. Come on.
BEN,  Let's go.  I know we can do this.
BEN," Once we can get them all in the same place... I don't know where we go from there, but we'll figure something out."
BEN, A woman?
BEN, Eloise Hawking? You sure?
BEN," Yes, John. I know her."
BEN," I'll miss you, John. I really will."
BEN, They're gone.
BEN,  How would I know?
BEN, Why are you following me?
BEN, Back to our Island.  ...You wanna come?
BEN," I'm sorry, Sun, but waiting doesn't interest me much right now.  There are three outriggers near here and I'm gonna take one.  So you can come along and help me row...  or you can stay here.  Frankly, it makes no difference to me."
BEN, Why are you staying?
BEN," Honestly, I don't know.  But that's where I'd start looking."
BEN," Hello, Frank."
BEN,  You're ready?
BEN, And how'd that work out for everyone?
BEN," That's right, Frank.  A captain's first responsibility is to his passengers.  But I have people I have to take care of, too.  There's a small dock about a half mile due south across the water.  It leads directly to a town where I used to live.  There are resources there.  So, if anyone can help you and the rest of the plane get out of here safely, it--"
BEN, How'd it go?
BEN, Of course it didn't.
BEN,  Nowhere. You're done.
BEN," We're done. Andropov was the last one. You've taken care of everyone who posed a threat to your friends.  It's been a pleasure working with you, Sayid. "
BEN," You didn't kill them for me, Sayid. You're the one that asked for their names. There's no one else in Widmore's organization that we need to go after. Congratulations! Mission accomplished! "
BEN," I suppose you should go live your life. You're free, Sayid. "
BEN, I looked.
BEN, John Locke is dead. I think he was murdered.
BEN," I'd say it was retribution for the work you and I have been doing. So you're in danger, Sayid. If I can find you, so can the people that found Locke. The same people who, even as we speak, are sitting outside Hugo's mental institution."
BEN," A man in a sedan has been there all week, just waiting... presumably for you or me to show our faces."
BEN, You don't want to?
BEN," Because, Sayid... to put it simply, you're capable of things that most other men aren't. Every choice you've made in your life, whether it was to murder or to torture, it hasn't really been a choice at all, has it? It's in your nature. It's what you are. You're a killer, Sayid."
BEN," Well, then I apologize. I was mistaken about you."
BEN,  There's somebody--somebody here in Los Angeles. Let me take you to them.
BEN, The same person that's gonna show us how to get back to the island.
BEN," Sayid, where are you going?"
BEN," Hold up! Wait, please! Thank you for not closing it."
BEN,  Please help.
BEN, There's someone...someone here in Los Angeles.  Let me take you to them.
BEN, The same person that's gonna show us how to get back to the island.
BEN,  Um... tell my...
BEN, Tell my dad I'm sorry I stole his keys.
BEN,  My God.  You're alive.
BEN, I knew it.  I knew that this would happen.
BEN,"  Because it's one thing to believe it, John.  It's another thing to see it."
BEN," I broke the rules, John.  I came back to the Island.  I was going to answer for what I'd done.  I was going back... to be judged."
BEN," Well, J-John, we don't even have a word for it, but I believe you call it the Monster."
BEN, Hello. What's in the crate?
BEN, Need a hand?
BEN, Okay.  Have a great day.
BEN," Like someone hit me with an oar, but I'll live."
BEN, I'm not sure.  What has he told you?
BEN," I killed him?  Really?  'Cause he looks fine to me.   You know, I don't really remember him from the plane.  Do you?"
BEN," What if... he was already here, before we crashed?  If he thinks I killed him, then he's insane.  We may be dealing with a man who's dangerously deranged.  Then the question is, what are we gonna do about it?"
BEN," Pleasure to meet you, Caesar.  I'm Ben."
BEN, Shh.
BEN,"  Shut up!  And stay here, Ethan."
BEN, Don't!  Don't do it.
BEN, Shh.
BEN," It's okay.  It's okay, baby."
BEN, Do you want your baby to live?
BEN," Be grateful you're still alive.  Now you listen to me.  If you try to follow me or if you ever come looking for me, I'll kill you.  And if you want your child to live, every time you hear whispers, you run the other way."
BEN, Just something sentimental.
BEN," Was there something that you needed, John?"
BEN, I assume you're referring to the fact that I killed you.
BEN," It was the only way to get you back to the Island, along with as many of those who left as possible.  You do remember, John--that's why you left in the first place, to convince 'em to come back?  But you failed.  And the only way to bring them together was by your death, and you understood that.  It's why you were about to kill yourself when I stopped you."
BEN," You had critical information that would've died with you.  And once you'd given it to me... well, I just didn't have time to talk you back into hanging yourself.  So I took a shortcut.  And look at you, John.  I was right.  You're here.  You're back.  So are the rest of them.  I don't know where yet exactly, but they came.  It worked.  And that's why I did it, because it was in the best interests of the Island. "
BEN, Help me do what?
BEN," That's not something you want to see, John."
BEN, He didn't really give me a choice.
BEN, You looking for this?
BEN, This gentleman and I are taking a boat.  Does anyone else have a problem with that?
BEN, Consider that my apology.
BEN, Home sweet home.
BEN," That would be Sun and Lapidus.  I showed 'em where the boats were, and Sun thanked me by smashing me on the head with a paddle."
BEN, No.  Someone else hurt my arm.
BEN," Well, I've found sometimes that friends can be significantly more dangerous than enemies, John."
BEN, The man was unarmed because I'd stolen his gun--the gun he was going to use to kill you.  I couldn't let that happen.
BEN, You're welcome.
BEN," Yes.  It's the only place I can summon it... the ""monster.""  Once it arrives, I'll either be forgiven... or I won't."
BEN, Lying about what?
BEN," Then what do I want to be judged for, John?"
BEN, We had a...
BEN, ...complication.
BEN," Why?  She's no threat to us.  She's insane, Charles.  Besides, you didn't tell me she had a child.  What was it I was supposed to do?"
BEN," It's not an ""it"".  This is a child."
BEN, Is killing this baby what Jacob wants?
BEN, Then here she is.
BEN, You do it.
BEN, Excuse me?
BEN," Do you disapprove, John?"
BEN, You don't have the first idea what this Island wants.
BEN," Yes, and that's Alex's room."
BEN, Sun?
BEN, This used to be my house.  I saw a light turned on.  What are the two of you doing in here?
BEN, Are you trying to tell me that your friends were in the DHARMA Initiative?
BEN, Of course not.  Where did you get this?  Who gave this to you?
BEN, Wait for what?
BEN," Well, you might want to look outside."
BEN," Yes, John.  That's right."
BEN, I'll be outside.
BEN, Okay.  Okay. 
BEN, All right.
BEN," Yes, Richard, I do."
BEN, Charles! 
BEN, I came to say good-bye.
BEN," No, don't act as if I wanted this.  You brought this on yourself."
BEN," You left the Island regularly.  You had a daughter with an outsider.  You broke the rules, Charles."
BEN, Because I won't be selfish.  Because I'll sacrifice anything to protect this Island.
BEN," You're the one who wanted her dead, Charles, not the Island."
BEN, Where did John go?
BEN, Did he say what it was?
BEN, Excuse me?
BEN, Jack didn't lie.  John was dead.
BEN,  Trust me.  I'm sure.
BEN," Sun, I had no idea it would happen.  I've seen this Island do miraculous things.  I've seen it heal the sick, but never once has it done anything like this.  Dead is dead.  You don't get to come back from that, not even here.  So the fact that John Locke is walking around this Island... scares the living hell out of me."
BEN, You may want to go inside.
BEN, Because what's about to come out of that jungle is something I can't control.
BEN, It hasn't shown up yet.
BEN," It's not a train, John.  It doesn't run on a schedule."
BEN, It doesn't work that way.  I only know how to summon it.  I don't know where it actually is.
BEN, Lead the way.
BEN, Charles?  It's Benjamin.
BEN, Doesn't matter.  What matters is I'm going back to the Island today.
BEN," Well, Charles, where you failed, I'm going to succeed... just as soon as I do one thing."
BEN," Kill your daughter.  In fact, I'm looking at Our Mutual Friend right now."
BEN, It's the name of the boat that Penny's on.
BEN," Good-bye, Charles."
BEN," May I ask you a question, John?"
BEN, How is it that you know where you're going?
BEN," I mean, how does that work, exactly?"
BEN," The knowing.  I mean, did it come upon you gradually, or did you wake up one morning suddenly understanding the mysteries of the universe?"
BEN, What?
BEN," No, John, I don't like it at all."
BEN," I think I know where we're going now, John."
BEN, It's the same place they brought me as a child.  It's where the Island healed me.
BEN, It's the wall around our Temple.
BEN, About a half mile from here.  We built this wall to keep people like the two of you from ever seeing it.
BEN," I need to ask a favor of you, Sun.  If you can ever get off this Island, find Desmond Hume for me.  Tell him I said I was sorry."
BEN,  He'll know.
BEN," Don't move.  Not another word.  Hello, Penelope.  My name is Benjamin Linus.  I'm sorry that you're caught up in the middle of this thing, but your father--"
BEN, Your father is a really terrible human being.  He's responsible for the killing of my daughter.  That's why I'm here.
BEN," You know, you were right."
BEN," Why I need to be judged.  When Charles Widmore's men came, they gave me a choice.  Either leave the Island or let my daughter die.  All I had to do was walk out of the house and go with them.  But I didn't do it.  So you were right.  John, I did kill Alex.  And now I have to answer for that.  I appreciate you showing me the way, but I think I can take it from here."
BEN," I'll meet you outside, if I live--Aah!"
BEN,  Never better.
BEN," John, wait!"
BEN, Alex.
BEN," Ohh, Alex.  I'm so, so sorry.  It was all my fault."
BEN," Yes, I will.  I'll follow him.  I swear. "
BEN, It let me live.
BEN," When I left the Island, John stepped in.  He's the leader now."
BEN," His name is Richard Alpert.  He's a kind of... adviser.  And he has had that job for a very, very long time."
BEN, Sun?  What are you...
BEN,"  What, John, don't you trust me here with my former people?  Afraid I'll stage a coup?"
BEN," Well, in that case, I'd love to come."
BEN," That's... not how it works, John."
BEN, What plane?
BEN," Who is that man, John?"
BEN, This must be quite the out-of-body experience.
BEN," Your timing was impeccable, John.  How did you know when to be here?"
BEN," No, John.  And clearly it hasn't told you where Jacob is, or you wouldn't need Richard to show you."
BEN, What?
BEN, What just happened?  Where did you go?
BEN, Why do you think I tried to kill him?
BEN, Yes... so far.  Richard had some concerns.
BEN, This pilgrimage to Jacob makes him uncomfortable.  He's expressed... reservations about whether or not you know what the hell you're doing.
BEN," I know we've had our differences in the past, John, but I'm here to follow you now.  So if you need Jacob to help you reunite your people, then I'll do whatever--"
BEN, What do you mean?  You told Sun--
BEN, Then why are we going to Jacob?
BEN, He's in charge of this Island. 
BEN," No, I said he was the leader, a title that I've discovered is incredibly temporary. But everyone answers to someone, and the leader answers to Jacob."
BEN," I don't know, Sun. I've never met him. "
BEN, Told who what?
BEN," If by plans you mean murdering him, John, I assumed you'd want to keep that a secret. "
BEN," Well, I starting thinking differently about things when my dead daughter threatened to destroy me if I didn't do everything you said."
BEN," In that cavern, beneath the Temple. When we went to see the monster."
BEN, Yes. 
BEN, Convince me to do what?
BEN, I was enjoying some alone time. 
BEN, It's a door. How about that?
BEN, I'm a Pisces.
BEN," Well, you clearly already know that I was talking to an empty chair, John. That I was pretending. Which is not to say that I wasn't as surprised as you were when things started flying around the room."
BEN," I was embarrassed. I didn't want you to know that I had never seen Jacob. So yes, I lied. That's what I do."
BEN," Why do you want me to kill Jacob, John?"
BEN, I don't know.  It was like that when I got here.
BEN, Not really.
BEN, John wants me to join him.
BEN, Have you met before?
BEN," What ""choice""?"
BEN," Oh... so now, after all this time, you've decided to stop ignoring me.  Thirty-five years I lived on this island, and all I ever heard was your name over and over.  Richard would bring me your instructions--all those slips of paper, all those lists--and I never questioned anything.  I did as I was told.  But when I dared to ask to see you myself, I was told, ""You have to wait.  You have to be patient.""  But when he asked to see you?  He gets marched straight up here as if was Moses.  So... why him?  Hmm?  What was it that was so wrong with me?  What about me?!"
BEN,  Oh.   Well...
BEN, Am I interrupting?
BEN, Alright. But there's a fairly reasonable chance that you won't believe me...
BEN, John Locke killed them.
BEN, Yes. He turned into a pillar of black smoke and killed them right before my eyes.
BEN, Yes...
BEN, Locke kicked him into the fire and he burned away.
BEN, Locke... do you know why he carried Richard into the jungle?
BEN, Why did you have to bring him to the statue in the first place?
BEN, And whats to stop what they're up against from changing his face?
BEN," Alright, I knew him. John Locke was a...a believer, he was a man of faith, he was... a much better man than I will ever be.  And I'm very sorry I murdered him."
BEN, Tea? Now there's a gentleman drink. I don't believe we met.
BEN," Ben Linus, European History."
BEN," Well, welcome."
BEN, I'll go get him.
BEN, Sayid? Come on. I know a way out of here. There's still time.
BEN, I'm fine. Thank you.
BEN," Considering that he just killed Dogen, I don't think he's going to be joining us."
BEN, Sayid killed the interpreter too.
BEN," He was standing over their dead bodies holding a bloody dagger, so yeah, I'm pretty sure."
BEN," Well, what about the beach?"
BEN, Where we buried Locke. Where they lived. At least we'll have the water at our backs and it's familiar territory. Anybody else got a better idea?
BEN," It was on this island that everything changed. That everything finally became clear. Elba... is where Napoleon faced his greatest test. Because exile wasn't the worst of his fate. What was truly devastating to him was the loss of his power. Sure, they allowed him to keep the title of Emperor... but without any power it was meaningless. He might just as well have been dead."
BEN," Alright. Remember, five and six tomorrow. Thank you."
BEN," Principal Reynolds, good morning."
BEN, What?
BEN," But we have history club today, those kids need me."
BEN, Shouldn't we be encouraging the ones with ambition?
BEN," It's Dr. Linus, actually."
BEN," What's the problem, Leslie?"
BEN, Budget cutbacks...
BEN, Principal Reynolds is an administrator. He's not a teacher. He's forgotten what the public school system is about.
BEN," No. Taking care of the kids, that's what's important."
BEN," Well, I know you've given up but I refuse to."
BEN, What do you mean I should be the principal?
BEN," I appreciate the sentiment, but who's going to listen to me?"
BEN, That thing's what killed her friends back at the statue.
BEN," Yeah, of course, and Jacob--"
BEN, What? That's not true!
BEN, Is there anything you'd like me to do?
BEN," You know, that psychic is totally unreliable. Miles actually tried to blackmail me once."
BEN," I made you one of the turkey meals, with the cranberry sauce that you like."
BEN," No, dad... it's organic. I'm trying to keep you healthy."
BEN," I have a doctorate in modern European history, and yet I'm babysitting burnouts in detention..."
BEN," And the worst of it is, as I look out at those ingrates that I'm tasked with watching, I can't help thinking that maybe I'm more a loser than any of them."
BEN, I know.
BEN," Yes, we'd have both lived happily ever after..."
BEN," Now, does that feel better?"
BEN, Alex?
BEN," Oh, I'm so sorry, I should've put a note on the door. The club meetings have to be postponed, I'm in detention all week."
BEN," Principal Reynolds needs me to cover, so..."
BEN," Alright, how about this? Tomorrow morning, 7 A.M. in the library. And you bring the coffee."
BEN," My pleasure, Alex."
BEN, See you.
BEN, Just lookin' for something useful...
BEN, God... the things people will bring on a trip...
BEN, Oceanic... I remember that plane breakin' in half like it was yesterday.
BEN, Maybe I am.
BEN, And why didn't you?
BEN, Come on...
BEN, How different would it have been? The island still got you in the end. Didn't it?
BEN," Okay, wait, you don't have to--"
BEN," What are you doing? Look, if this is about what Miles said--"
BEN, What?
BEN, Digging what?
BEN, For who?
BEN," Now, you know this. I know you do."
BEN," Very good. Now, moving on to the Charter Act of 1813. At the time of the Charter, the East India Trading Company's power extended to all of India, except for..."
BEN," It's okay, it's okay. It's just a test."
BEN," Alex, I think you're being a bit over-dramatic."
BEN, You're one of the brightest students I've ever had. I don't worry about your future at all.
BEN," Really. Now, what can I do to help? I'll write you a great letter of recommendation, I'll--"
BEN, Excuse me? Pervert?
BEN, Alex... has Principal Reynolds... done something to you?
BEN, Then what is it?
BEN," Of course, I promise."
BEN, Totally.
BEN," No. No, a promise is a promise. Well... shall we return to the high seas?"
BEN, I'm not in a big hurry.
BEN, I'm not really hungry.
BEN, Miles... do you remember once you asked me for 3.2 million dollars? Do you still want it?
BEN," I can get off this island. And when I do, I have a vast network of people and resources that will get you that money. All you have to do is cut me loose."
BEN," I can't believe you're just gonna stand by and watch this happen. Ilana's gonna murder me for killing Jacob, a man who didn't even care about being killed!"
BEN, Excuse me?
BEN, Do you have a minute?
BEN, You're pretty good with computers aren't you?
BEN, Could you...hypothetically...access someone's email account without their knowledge?
BEN, Say a faculty account. Hypothetically
BEN, Nurse Kondraki.
BEN," No, I'm just...curious about some of her correspondence."
BEN, All right. I have reason to believe that she might be engaged in an inappropriate personal relationship with principal Reynolds.
BEN," Are you going to help me or not, Leslie?"
BEN, Deal.
BEN, What are you doing here?
BEN, I'm digging my own grave.
BEN, Because you talked me into killing Jacob. You see that woman over there eating a mango? She's his bodyguard and she knows what I did. So now you've got what you wanted because she's going to kill me. 
BEN, Get me? For what?
BEN, Me?
BEN," Well it doesn't seem very likely does it, under the circumstances. How am I going to get away from..."
BEN, She'll come after me.
BEN," That's not why I'm here, I want you to read something."
BEN," Those are thirty emails that cover a three-month period. It's pretty lascivious stuff, which would be fine if it was private, but they seem to describe acts that took place on school property. Acts which, morality aside, I think the school board would frown on, not to mention your wife."
BEN," Your job. You're going to resign. For, I don't know - personal reasons, health - your call. But with your resignation you're going to recommmend the school board hire me as your replacement. And the irony of all this is that they hold you in such esteem that I'll get the job. So, do we have an understanding?"
BEN, Drop it! Put the gun down!
BEN, I want to explain.
BEN, I want to explain that I know what you're feeling. 
BEN," I watched my daughter Alex die in front of me. And it was my fault. I had a chance to save her. But I chose the island over her. All in the name of Jacob. I sacrificed everything for him. And he didn't even care. Yeah I stabbed him, I was... so angry...confused...I was terrified that I was about to lose the only thing that had ever mattered to me - my power. But the thing that really mattered was already gone. I'm sorry that I killed Jacob. I am, and I do not expect you to forgive me because...I can never forgive myself."
BEN, Just let me leave.
BEN, To Locke.
BEN, Because he's the only one that'll have me.
BEN, Hello Alex.
BEN," Wow, wonderful. "
BEN," No, it wasn't me Alex. But I always say you're a great student, obviously I wasn't the only one who noticed. "
BEN," Just dropping off the detention sign-up sheet for the week, per your request. "
BEN,  So will I see you in history club?
BEN," Oh no, we've got our old slot back. Principal Reynolds found someone to cover for detention. Isn't that right?"
BEN," Well then, see you at four."
BEN, No.
BEN, You can have mine.
BEN, Do you need a hand?
BEN," Oh, this should be interesting."
BEN," If it's any consolation, it's not exactly Locke."
BEN," Shephard is right, you know."
BEN, Richard. Going after him is a waste of time. He doesn't know anything.
BEN," I've known him since I was twelve years old, that should count for something."
BEN," No Frank, I was a kid. Richard looked just like he does today."
BEN, That's exactly what I'm saying.
BEN, Now what?
BEN, Wait... for what?
BEN," You'll forgive my skepticism, but... the last thing Richard said before he went stomping off into the jungle was that we were all in Hell and he had no idea what we were supposed to do next! In fact, I would bet money we never see him again!"
BEN," Sun? Sun, can you hear me? "
BEN, What happened? You alright?
BEN," I'm sorry, what?"
BEN, Slow down. Tell me what happened in English. Who did this to you?
BEN," What? Oh, for the fourth time, I was gathering mangoes and she was already unconscious when I found her. Why won't you believe me?"
BEN, What?
BEN, Hydra island.
BEN, Now what?
BEN," Kinda makes you think, doesn't it?"
BEN," Ilana. There she was - handpicked by Jacob, trained to come and protect you candidates, no sooner does she tell you who you are, then she blows up. The Island was done with her. Makes me wonder what's gonna happen when it's done with us."
BEN," Yes, I think so."
BEN, Are you trying to get us killed?
BEN, I am.
BEN, Hello there. You wating for someone in particular?
BEN," Well, I noticed you've been parked here a while watching the kids, and well, it is a school. Do you have a child who goes here?"
BEN, What's your son's name?
BEN," Well, as a teacher here I can vouch for it completely. It's a wonderful school. "
BEN, Have a good day.
BEN," Call 911, do it now! Mr. Locke? Oh, my God. Don't, don't move. We're gonna get you to the hospital. Mr. Locke? Mr. Locke? Can you hear me?"
BEN, That's because he's a paraplegic.
BEN," Yes, he's a substitute teacher at my school. His name is Locke... Mr. Locke. I don't know his first name, but he uses a wheelchair. Where is it?"
BEN," I saw the man that did this... the, the hit-and-run driver. He, he was at our school--"
BEN," I have no idea. Like I said, I barely know him."
BEN, What did you say?
BEN," Well, you're still gonna marry her 'cause you're gonna be okay, Mr. Locke."
BEN, Hey! Don't you dare!  It's him! The guy who hit Mr. Locke. Someone call the police right now!
BEN, I saw what you did. I'm making a citizen's arrest. 
BEN, Don't you--
BEN, I will not let you hurt Mr. Locke again!
BEN, Who are you?
BEN," I lived in these houses a long time, Miles. I think I can remember how to get there. "
BEN," Guess it's a good thing, you're following me."
BEN, More than enough to destroy the plane ten times over and keep it from ever leaving this island.
BEN," It's C-4, Richard. I put some thought into hiding it. "
BEN, Don't be ridiculous... It's in my secret room behind the bookcase.
BEN, What's wrong?
BEN," Do you have something you wanna share with us, Miles?"
BEN, What is it?
BEN,"  Thank you, Richard."
BEN, It's where I was told I could summon the monster. That's before I realized that it was the one summoning me.
BEN," Okay. Richard, it's your idea. Are we looking to cripple the plane or blow it to hell?"
BEN, Then we'd better take it all.
BEN, Who the hell are you?
BEN, What are you doing here?
BEN," She's not going anywhere. If you don't answer me, I swear--"
BEN, None of your damned business.
BEN," How did you get back here, Charles?"
BEN, That's a lie. You’ve never even seen Jacob.
BEN, What purpose?
BEN," It's Doctor Linus, actually."
BEN, I guess I got into a fight.
BEN," I saw the man that ran you down, Mr. Locke. He was back. I approached him, and he just attacked me. And then the strangest thing happened. While he was beating me, I think--I think I saw something.  What are you doing?"
BEN, You may not want to do that. 
BEN, The man told me that he wasn't trying to hurt you. He told me that he was trying to get you to let go. 
BEN," And for some reason, I believed him."
BEN," Do you have any idea what he was talking about, Mr. Locke? Does that mean something to you?"
BEN, I'm not interested in hiding. He's gonna find me sooner or later anyway. I'd rather have it over with.
BEN," Miles, wait.  Give me your walkie-talkies."
BEN, Because I asked.  Thank you.  In case I need you...
BEN, Then I guess this is goodbye.
BEN,  Care to join me outside while I wait for the inevitable?
BEN," Well, you found me."
BEN, Can I get you a glass of lemonade?
BEN, And...why would I do that?
BEN, All right.
BEN, I believe it's Charles Widmore's.
BEN, He's hiding in my closet.
BEN," Hello, Alex."
BEN, I found myself confronting someone that had a bit of a temper. 
BEN, Guess they had me confused with somebody else.
BEN," Oh, no, I'm not going to be any trouble to you."
BEN, Excellent point.
BEN, Benjamin Linus.
BEN," Oh, that's really not necessary--"
BEN," If you don't mind my asking, where is her father?"
BEN, Oh.
BEN, Excuse me?
BEN, I'm fine. I'm sure it's the onions.
BEN, After you... Charles and his lady friend are in here... She's armed. But I'm guessing that's not a problem for you.
BEN, I want to see this.
BEN," Sorry, Charles."
BEN, He doesn't get to save his daughter.
BEN, Good... Did you say there were some other people to kill?
BEN," Hey, can I ask you something?"
BEN," If you can turn yourself into smoke whenever you want, why do you bother walking?"
BEN, Are you thirsty?
BEN, What's the matter?
BEN, Looks like someone helped him out. 
BEN, What did Widmore say to you?
BEN, Then...why are you happy that he's still alive?
BEN," As long as you’re watching, why don't you join us?"
BEN, Ahh! Ohh! Aah.
BEN, You're not gonna go after him?
BEN," When you said you were gonna destroy the island, I thought you were speaking figuratively."
BEN, What was what?
BEN," Miles, where are you?"
BEN," Miles, listen to me. Whatever you do, don't blow up that plane."
BEN," Hugo, get out the way!"
BEN, Ohh!
BEN, I know how we can get there! Locke has a boat.
BEN,  Lapidus?
BEN," Frank, how's it going over there? What's your timetable?"
BEN, Sounds like they're making progress.
BEN, James!
BEN," If the Island's going down, I'm going down with it."
BEN, I do.  Is that okay?
BEN," He did it, the light's back on."
BEN, Hello John.
BEN," I believe most of them are, yes."
BEN," I'm very sorry for what I did to you John. I was selfish, jealous. I wanted everything you had."
BEN," You were special, John... and I wasn't."
BEN," Thank you, John...that does help. It matters more than I can say."
BEN, I have some things I still need to work out. I think I'll stay here a while.
BEN," You know, I don't think you need to be in that chair anymore."
BEN, I think Desmond's gonna be okay.
BEN," He did his job, Hugo."
BEN, I think you do what you do best. Take care of people. You can start by helping Desmond get home.
BEN, That's how Jacob ran things... Maybe there's another way. A better way.
BEN, I'm sorry?
BEN, I'd be honored.
BEN," Hello, Hugo!"
BEN, I don't think I'm coming in.
BEN," And you were a great number one, Hugo."
