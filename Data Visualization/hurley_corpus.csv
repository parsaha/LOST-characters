HURLEY," Oh, you got to be kidding me."
HURLEY, Hey! What's your name?
HURLEY," Dude, I'm not going anywhere."
HURLEY, Hungry?
HURLEY," Anymore, uh... you know, baby stuff?"
HURLEY," Well, hang in there."
HURLEY,  Yeah.
HURLEY," Technically, you know, we don't even know if we're on an island."
HURLEY," So, I was just looking inside the fuselage … It's pretty grim in there. You think we should do something about the, uh …  b-o-d-y-s?"
HURLEY, I don't know if you want to go in there! There's too many bodies.
HURLEY," Hey! We're all this together, man. Let's treat each other with a little respect."
HURLEY, Tsss. Chain-smoking jackass...
HURLEY, Tsss. Some people have problems? Us. Him. You're okay. I like you.
HURLEY,"  Hurley.  Uh, just…"
HURLEY, How do you know to do all that?
HURLEY, Oh yeah? You ever see battle?
HURLEY, No way! I got a buddy who fought over there. He was in the 104th airborne. What were you - Air Force... Army?
HURLEY," What's that? What, that? What, eat that?  Dude. Dude. I'm... starving... But, I'm nowhere near that hungry.  No. No. No, thank you! No way, no. "
HURLEY, Okay.
HURLEY, What's this for? 
HURLEY, You sure he's out?
HURLEY, How do you know he won't wake up when you yank that thing out?
HURLEY," Hey, guy, are you awake? Yo, there's a rescue plane! We're saved! Yaaay!  Yeah, he's out. So—what do you want me..."
HURLEY," Uh... I'm not so good around blood, man."
HURLEY, Yeah. But.. I'm not so good around blood.
HURLEY, Okay .
HURLEY, Dude. 
HURLEY, Dude.
HURLEY, I don't think I can.
HURLEY," ""Oh"" what? What, what's going on, something in there? "
HURLEY, Was it a dinosaur?
HURLEY, You say you didn't see it. 
HURLEY, So how do you know it wasn't a dinosaur?
HURLEY, Oh. Yeah.  So what's his story? He looks kind of... dying.
HURLEY," He's yellow, man."
HURLEY, What if they don't?
HURLEY, He looks like he's in pain.
HURLEY," What's this? Uh, dude? Uh...  What do you think she did?"
HURLEY, She looks pretty hard core.
HURLEY," Dude, dude, they're back."
HURLEY, So what'd she say?
HURLEY, But you told her you knew?
HURLEY," Well, you kind of know she's in that mug shot. And that we found those handcuffs. And that guy keeps mumbling ""she's dangerous, she's dangerous"" over and over."
HURLEY," Yeah, you're right. We'll let Johnny Fever take care of her when he gets better."
HURLEY, That stuff I got from the luggage...
HURLEY," We went through everything, man."
HURLEY, That's inside the plane.
HURLEY," But, the bodies are in there, and they're all... dead."
HURLEY, Great. Yeah - love to - on it.
HURLEY, I was going to get some more water.
HURLEY," Hi, Kate."
HURLEY, Hurley.
HURLEY," Yeah, no. Uh, he went to go get some medicine... over there."
HURLEY," What? Yeah, in the uh, uh, you know? I've got to get that water. "
HURLEY," Yo, so, where's the fugitive?"
HURLEY, You let her in there alone?
HURLEY," Yeah, but she's got that gun."
HURLEY," She's strapped, man. I saw it in her... in her... in her... in her..."
HURLEY," Oh, no way. Guys?"
HURLEY,"  Man, is he still breathing?"
HURLEY,  Oh boy.
HURLEY," Oh crud, now what?"
HURLEY, What's your problem? Hand them over.
HURLEY, There's other people here or don't you give a crap? 
HURLEY, Oh that's bull and you know it. You're not happy unless you're screwing over everybody... 
HURLEY, Jethro here's hoarding the last of the peanuts.
HURLEY," There is no rest of the food, dude. We kind of—ate it all."
HURLEY, Who is this guy?
HURLEY," Dude, quit asking me that. "
HURLEY," Yeah, off the Santa Monica pier with my old man and a fishing pole and bait. Never had to try and poke one with a sharp stick."
HURLEY," Anything to keep me far away from that fuselage and that freakin' redneck jerk.  Damn it, crap, crap, son of a..."
HURLEY," Knock yourself out. Okay, here comes one. Put your weight into it. Now, you see it? Wait for it, wait... now. . Dude, you've got to try to pin it. "
HURLEY," So, like, what happened out there?"
HURLEY, Hey Jack! 
HURLEY," Whoa. You look tired, brother. "
HURLEY, We got a problem. 
HURLEY," People just kind of took what they needed because we were supposed to be rescued, but we weren't. "
HURLEY," People find out this is all we have left, they're going to freak out, man. "
HURLEY, Maybe we can make one of those water finding sticks.
HURLEY, Maybe the dog can find water?
HURLEY," I mean, dogs can find pot and bombs, so I'm sure they can find water."
HURLEY, Why not? 
HURLEY," Uh, the Chinese people have water. "
HURLEY,"  Guys, that Chinese dude is going to get pretty crispy out here. How long are you going to keep him tied down like that?"
HURLEY," Hey man, I go where the boar's at. So, what's up with you and Kate? You guys going to move into a cave together, or what? "
HURLEY," Well, that wasn't a denial. "
HURLEY, Short walk. They lied. 
HURLEY," Dude, what's in these things, cinderblocks?"
HURLEY," Oh, could I?"
HURLEY," Hey, dude. This yours?"
HURLEY," Listen, uh, man. Jack just wants you to find another place for it. He's moving supplies and says it's in the way. "
HURLEY," Oh, no. "
HURLEY," Charlie, where's Jack? Where's Jack?"
HURLEY," Jack, Jack can you hear me? "
HURLEY," Dude, we gotta get help. Charlie, go down to the beach and get help."
HURLEY, And make sure you tell Kate!
HURLEY, Jack's in there.
HURLEY," Well, how do you know-"
HURLEY, Locke's out in the jungle killing stuff. Who knows where he is.
HURLEY," Jack? Jack? Can you hear me, Jack? Come on dude, answer me."
HURLEY, I hear him.
HURLEY," Jack, bro, you okay?"
HURLEY,  What do we do? How do we get him out? 
HURLEY, He's okay. He made it out. 
HURLEY," What, crawl through that?"
HURLEY," Dude, we don't understand Chinese."
HURLEY, Charlie?
HURLEY," Good luck, Charlie."
HURLEY, I say we try again.
HURLEY," If we don't move, they're going to run out of air. "
HURLEY,  He's in there.
HURLEY, How'd you get out?
HURLEY," Dude, you rock. "
HURLEY,"  Dude, you feeling okay? You look a little..."
HURLEY," Oh man, that's rough after all you've been through. Take it easy, man. "
HURLEY," Wow, man. That was awesome. I mean, that was like a -- Jedi moment. "
HURLEY," Food from the plane's been gone for over a week, dude."
HURLEY," Sorry, man. No peanut butter. No peanuts. No nothing. "
HURLEY, Look at what?
HURLEY," Fat guy hoarding the food, is that what you think?"
HURLEY, Slimmed down much? 
HURLEY," I have no food, alright?! And for the record, I'm down a notch in my belt. I'm a big guy, it's going to be a while before you're going to want to give me a piggy back ride, okay?"
HURLEY, Yeah. I'm used to it. 
HURLEY, Dude.
HURLEY," Uh, you know, the usual -- people yelling at each other over nothing. "
HURLEY, Try to keep your mind off it? What else has that guy got to do but stress?
HURLEY," Yeah, but that's like my point, man. We're all fried. I'm mean, have you taken a look at everybody out there? Everybody's way tense. Dude, I'm just saying, it'd be sweet if we could have, I don't know, something to do."
HURLEY, How? 
HURLEY, Yo. What's this? 
HURLEY, What are you guys doing out in the jungle at night?
HURLEY," Rodent, yum."
HURLEY," You got that right. Alright, well, I'll take a look at these , and see if there's anything useful."
HURLEY,"  Whoa, dude. "
HURLEY,  Come on. Come on. I know I saw it.  Yes. 
HURLEY," Hold on, man. I'm busy."
HURLEY,"  Dude, can I borrow this?"
HURLEY,"  Thanks, man."
HURLEY," Welcome, to the first, and hopefully last, Island Open. "
HURLEY," It's two holes for now, 3 par, and no waiting. "
HURLEY, Rich idiots fly to tropical islands all the time to whack balls around.
HURLEY," Dudes, listen. Our lives suck. Everyone's nerves are stretched to the max. I mean, we're lost on an Island, running from boars and monsters -- freakin' polar bears!"
HURLEY," Look, all I'm saying is, if we're stuck here, then just surviving's not going to cut it. We need some kind of relief, you know. We need some way that we can, you know, have fun. That's right, fun. Or else we're just going to go crazy waiting for the next bad thing to happen."
HURLEY," Dude, I think he stuck it."
HURLEY,"  Aw, crap, do over."
HURLEY," Dude, get away from me."
HURLEY," Dude, you were robbed. "
HURLEY, 5 bucks says he sinks it. 
HURLEY," Sorry, dude, but you're a duffer like me."
HURLEY, What's going on?
HURLEY," We looked around the entire perimeter, man. "
HURLEY," Uh-uh, nada. Everyone was asleep. So, I had an idea. I'm out here looking for some psycho with Scott and Steve, right? And I'm realizing who the hell are Scott and Steve? "
HURLEY," Look, if I was a cop and some woman got attacked, we'd canvas, right? Knock on doors, find witnesses. But we don't even have doors. "
HURLEY," Look, we don't know who's living here and who's still at the beach. I mean, we don't even know each other. My name isn't Hurley, it's Hugo Reyes. Hurley's just a nickname I have, alright? Why? I'm not telling. The point is, we've got to find out who everyone is. "
HURLEY," Yeah, a registry, you know, names, what people look like, who's related to who. I mean, we start laying down the law, maybe we'll stop attacking each other. It seems like someone's getting punched, or stabbed, or something every other day here. We've got to find out who did this to her. "
HURLEY," John, right? John Locke? "
HURLEY," Yeah, you know, I thought it'd be a good idea, you know, to get everyone's name and place of residence. "
HURLEY," Uh, me?"
HURLEY," Uh, good one. "
HURLEY," Cool. And, reason for travel? The reason you were in Australia?"
HURLEY," Looking, uh-huh. So, did you find it?"
HURLEY,"  No, no. That's good. Uh, thanks."
HURLEY," Hey, uh, I know I already talked to you, but, uh, I just wanted to get away from him fast, okay?"
HURLEY," Hey, Lance."
HURLEY," Lance. Your name's Lance, right?"
HURLEY," Dude, that's right. Lance is the little skinny guy with the glasses and the red hair. "
HURLEY," Sorry, dude. Lots of names and faces. It's pretty pathetic, huh? You'd think after a couple of weeks on the Island with the same people, we'd all know each other. "
HURLEY," So, we're doing this list, you know, survivors, names, home addresses, stuff like that. "
HURLEY, Not Lance.
HURLEY, Last name?
HURLEY," Rom, R-O-M? "
HURLEY," Great, where are you from Ethan Rom?"
HURLEY," Right on, love Canada, great uh... well that should do it. Thanks for your time, dude."
HURLEY," Oh, it's nothing. It's just, uh, you know, I thought I'd be a good idea."
HURLEY," So, uh, where were you guys last night?"
HURLEY, You're like the 20th person to ask me that. Why is everyone so uptight about answering a few questions?
HURLEY," Ah, it's nothing, we just had a little incident in the valley last night."
HURLEY," Yeah, Claire, the pregnant girl, you know her, she, uh, kind of got attacked. "
HURLEY," Yeah, she's a little shook up, but..."
HURLEY, What? Really? Where is it?
HURLEY, I'm just going to lay it out straight. 
HURLEY," I hear you have the flight manifest, and I need it, and I want you to give it to me. "
HURLEY," Now, you could do what you normally do when someone asks for something -- tell me to screw off."
HURLEY," Or, you could just give it to me -- because, dude, you could use the points. "
HURLEY, It's a gift. 
HURLEY," We've got a problem. The manifest, Jack, the census, the names of everyone who survived, all 46 of us. I interviewed everyone. Here, at the beach, got their names. One them, one of them isn't -- Jack! One of them isn't in the manifest. He wasn't on the plane. "
HURLEY, He wasn't on the plane.
HURLEY," Ethan, the Canadian guy, he is not on the passenger manifest."
HURLEY," I don't know. I saw him yesterday, but now..."
HURLEY," We're all tweaked, man. Locke's just feeling it like the rest of us."
HURLEY," Back home, I'm known as something of a warrior myself."
HURLEY, Crap.
HURLEY," Yeah, I know my blacks can't get in."
HURLEY, Yahoo.
HURLEY," Dude, would you please roll?"
HURLEY, No!
HURLEY, I didn't just start playing. I took 17th in a tournament once. 
HURLEY," No, 17th is very good. "
HURLEY," Aw, you've got to be kidding me,"
HURLEY, No one is that lucky.
HURLEY, Really?
HURLEY, Can't. I have a meeting.
HURLEY, Yeah. A meeting.
HURLEY, You'll get it.
HURLEY,  What's he trying to do?
HURLEY,  Good luck.
HURLEY,"  Yo, Boone. Question for you, dude. "
HURLEY," You and Locke are going out hunting boar everyday, right?"
HURLEY," That's cool, except, how come you're not coming back with any? We haven't had fresh pork on a plate in about a week, dude."
HURLEY, Maybe you guys aren't trying hard enough?
HURLEY," I hope so, because people need food, man -- solid food. This isn't a game, man."
HURLEY," So, Jack?"
HURLEY," Something kind of important I'd want to ask you about. Um, anything I tell you is doctor-patient confidential, right?"
HURLEY, The thing is -- I haven't been feeling so great.
HURLEY," Well, it's kind of like, uh, my stomach. I've been having some, um, major digestive issues."
HURLEY," You know, the usual - bananas, papayas, mangoes, guava, passion fruit, coconut. Some of those weird star fruits from up on the hill. Someone said they might be good for digestion. Let me tell you, they lied. "
HURLEY," Dude, what can I do? There's no boar. No boar, no protein. "
HURLEY," No way, man. That guy has it in for me. "
HURLEY," I'm not kidding. He offered me something to eat, like right after we, you know, got here, um, the thing with the spikes?"
HURLEY, Yeah. And when I turned him down it's like I soiled his family honor or something. He hasn't looked me in the eye since. The guy holds a serious grudge. 
HURLEY," Dude, these aren't for eating. Excuse me."
HURLEY,"  Jin!  Yo, Jin! Alto. Listen, I know you don't like me because of the sea urchin thing. But that's okay because I'm not asking for any favors. Just let me know where you get the fish. Fish  Just point me in the right direction. I'll take care of my own business with my own tools.  "
HURLEY," You just said something mean, didn't you?"
HURLEY, Damn it!
HURLEY," You know what? Fine. You win, okay? You happy now? Keep your damn fish, I'm out of here."
HURLEY," Ow! Ow, ow, ow! "
HURLEY," I stepped in a friggin' urchin! Ow, you understand me?!  Do you understand infection, gangrene, amputation?! "
HURLEY," Ow, aw, ow! You've got to do something for me."
HURLEY," You're going to have to pee on my foot, man. It'll stop the venom. I saw it on TV.  Ow, arrgh, no just pee on it man.  "
HURLEY," You need to pee, pee on it. Pee on my foot. I'll lose my foot if you don't. Just pee! Pee on it! Pee on- "
HURLEY, You sure you don't speak English? Cuz there's a rumor that you do. -- Your wife's hot.
HURLEY," Oh, I get it, this is some kind of payback because I wouldn't eat the urchin the other time? I eat this you give me a fish, right? Okay, fine. Over the lips and past the gums, yada yada, oh god. "
HURLEY,"  Dude, did you find your own bag? That's awesome, man. "
HURLEY, Be nice to get to use your own toothbrush again.
HURLEY, Yeah. Yippee.
HURLEY,"  Knock yourself out. You want to wish something on your worst enemy? Hope they step on a sea urchin.  Oh hey, thanks. Dude, has this thing already been cleaned? Are you kidding me? "
HURLEY,"  Yo, dudes. Got a new tourney lined up. We're playing for the last of the deodorant sticks. You dogs up for some golf?"
HURLEY," He seems to hate it, doesn't he?"
HURLEY, Being a dad.
HURLEY, No. He hates it. 
HURLEY," Uh, dude? Your kid's gone."
HURLEY, He just grabbed the dog and took off. 
HURLEY," Charlie, man! Is she injured?"
HURLEY, I thought those guys had a full on perimeter set up?
HURLEY," You sure it wasn't an accident? I mean, maybe the guy just drowned or something. "
HURLEY," Yeah, okay. Got it. "
HURLEY," Dude, that was Scott."
HURLEY," Scott Jackson worked for an internet company in Santa Cruz. He won a sales prize two week Australian vacation, all expenses paid. He was a good guy. Sorry, I kept calling you Steve, man. Um, amen, I guess. I..."
HURLEY, I don't know how to end these. 
HURLEY," Yeah, 'til he rises from the dead. Dude, I know how this works. This is going to end with you and me running through the jungle screaming and crying. He catches me first because I'm heavy and I get cramps. "
HURLEY, You alright? 
HURLEY," Yo, Sayid, can I ask you a question?"
HURLEY, Did you ever get that Gulf War syndrome? 
HURLEY," Oh, right. Then what's the one when you're all, like, shell-shocked?"
HURLEY," Yeah, that's it. Did you ever have that?"
HURLEY, Because I'm worried about Charlie.
HURLEY," I mean, he killed a guy. He shot him in the chest 4 times. Maybe you should talk to him."
HURLEY,"  You should try sea urchin. They've got more ping. Hey, so listen, I know things got kind of nasty down there at the beach, and, um, I don't want to get involved in husband and wife stuff, but I figured, you know, you might need to relax.  So...  C'mon, dude, I'm trying here. Okay, you want to be an outsider? It's your business."
HURLEY," Hang on, man. You've got to slow down. Slow down!"
HURLEY," Look, everybody chill out."
HURLEY, Didn't see that coming.
HURLEY, Son of a bitch.
HURLEY," Hold on a second, you want what now?"
HURLEY, You want to make snowballs?
HURLEY, Didn't Sayid say that crazy French chick has batteries? 
HURLEY," Dude, we just trying to-"
HURLEY," Don't know, dude? Or don't want to?"
HURLEY," Uno momento, Mama, just checking something out. "
HURLEY," Look, mom, we've talked about this. You want me living here -- you've got to respect my privacy. And no, I'm not. "
HURLEY," Yeah, I'll get right on that. "
HURLEY, Hi. You awake?
HURLEY," So, that French lady, she wrote this stuff, right?"
HURLEY," Nothing. Couldn't sleep, then I got curious. You and Shannon, you guys have been trying to figure out some of this stuff and I was wondering what, you know, you guys figured out about this stuff."
HURLEY," I don't know. Look, take these numbers she wrote down a bunch of times - got any idea what it means?"
HURLEY," Coordinates, yeah. When you first found her, the French chick, you said you saw a wire or something on the beach? And you followed it, and it led you to her?"
HURLEY," Her place is probably close, right?"
HURLEY," I'm not -- just, you know, making conversation, dude. Sorry if it's a bad time. Goodnight. "
HURLEY," Yeah, you."
HURLEY," Oh, they just, uh, sort of came to me."
HURLEY," Oh yeah, okay, um, this -- this patch of beauty is my mom, Carmen. Come here, mom. And this is my brother, Diego and his wife, Lisa. "
HURLEY," Nice, dude. Ignore him, he's an idiot. And, uh, oh, you've got to know this guy. This is the greatest guy I know, my, my, my grandpa Tito. He's worked 3 jobs for -- how long has it been now? "
HURLEY," 52 years. 70 years old, and the closest thing he's had to a vacation is when they put a pacemaker in him 4 years ago. So the first thing I'm going to do with the money is, uh, finally give him the rest that he's earned. That's really what it's all about for me, to be able to do things for the people I care about, because I really put my family through a lot recently, and, um, well, this way I can make it up to them. You know, maybe even buy my mom a new house. And uh,  maybe after my grandpa comes back from his cruise we can, you know --  do some things that we always wanted to do.  Grandpa?"
HURLEY," What, I'm not doing anything."
HURLEY, What?
HURLEY," Oh, right. Morning. Sorry, I was just, uh..."
HURLEY," Me? No. Well, yeah. Just thought I might take a walk. Uh, maybe scope out some new fishing area."
HURLEY, That's okay.
HURLEY," Dude, I could really use some alone time right now."
HURLEY," I'm a big guy, I get dehydrated easy."
HURLEY,"  Uh, sorry."
HURLEY," You're going to like this one, ma. I mean, after everything you've been through? Like grandpa --  And then at the funeral, Father Aguillar getting struck by lightening? Man, that was a freak storm. And Diego moving back home after Lisa left him for that . . . waitress?"
HURLEY," I'm just saying you deserve something good to happen. You know, ever since I won the lottery it's like we've had nothing but bad luck. Like, I don't know, like the money's cursed or something."
HURLEY," Jeez, ma, I'm just talking. Okay, we're almost there. Here, put this on."
HURLEY, Give me your hand. Careful.
HURLEY, You're stepping down.
HURLEY," Okay, now take off your blindfold. And get a look  at your new dream house."
HURLEY, I said take off your blindfold. 
HURLEY," Oh, crap. Hang on mom, I've got to call 911."
HURLEY," Oh, no, no, no. It's the house."
HURLEY," No such thing as curses, huh, ma?"
HURLEY, Yo! French chick!
HURLEY, A box company?
HURLEY, I have a sneaker factory in Canada? 
HURLEY, Of course it was. 
HURLEY, Bad luck.
HURLEY," What, you don't believe in jinxes? You know, curses?"
HURLEY, What?
HURLEY," No, it's nothing, it's something that I . . ."
HURLEY," That's it. It's not the money, it's the numbers. The numbers are cursed. Dude, don't look at me like that, I'm not crazy. This is real. "
HURLEY," Hey, what are you guys..."
HURLEY,"  Oh, man. "
HURLEY, Hey!
HURLEY, Can I drop the wire?
HURLEY, I'm dropping the wire.
HURLEY,  I can make it.
HURLEY," I can get out of the way, I'm spry."
HURLEY, Nothing.
HURLEY, I came to get a battery.
HURLEY, Nada. You guys coming?
HURLEY," Lenny. His name is Lenny, or Leonard. "
HURLEY," Look, I just need to talk to him for five minutes. "
HURLEY," How many Leonards are here? Can't you just type in Leonard? I mean, the guy's been here for, like, ever. He knows me."
HURLEY,"  Dude! Do not do that right now! Leave the bulb for another time, man!  five minutes! All I need is five minutes! "
HURLEY," Oh, hey, Doc."
HURLEY, Uh...
HURLEY," Yeah, well, we hung."
HURLEY," C'mon, Lenny, give me something. Anything. Where'd you get the numbers? Is that why you're here, Lenny? Is it because of the numbers? Did they do something to you? Because I think they did something to me. I think they turned me into a jinx -- bad news to everyone around me. And when I tell people I think I'm the cause they, they, they look at me like I'm nuts. They don't believe me. But I know, ever since I won the lottery with those numbers."
HURLEY," Uh, -- yeah. "
HURLEY, I what?
HURLEY, Why not? 
HURLEY," Wait a second, I need some answers. "
HURLEY," Those numbers, where'd you get them?"
HURLEY, Who's Sam Toomey?!?
HURLEY, It's a town where?!
HURLEY, Whoa.
HURLEY," Relax, I'm just going to check it out. You guys should stay here."
HURLEY," Dudes, chill."
HURLEY," Dude, you okay?"
HURLEY," Nah, screw that! You guys stay! There's a path right here, Charlie and me-"
HURLEY," Hi, is this Sam Toomey's house?"
HURLEY," Is he around, because I'd kind of like to talk to him."
HURLEY," Your husband worked with a guy I know, Leonard Sims. "
HURLEY," Uh, he's, um, retired. Anyway, he told me about Sam hearing something."
HURLEY," Yes, the numbers, exactly. Do you know anything about them?"
HURLEY, Sam used the numbers?
HURLEY, What about Sam?
HURLEY, Did it? Did he ever find a way to make it stop? 
HURLEY," I used them, the numbers, to win the lottery. And now I think I'm under the same curse."
HURLEY, But you just told me...
HURLEY," Well, yeah."
HURLEY, Jack! Sayid!
HURLEY, The blast sounded like it came from this way. I think.
HURLEY," Dude, what do you want from me?"
HURLEY," Dude, you don't know me. "
HURLEY," We've all got personal stuff, dude. "
HURLEY, I am not crazy. I've got my reasons for every-
HURLEY," Okay, alright, you want to know?"
HURLEY, About a year ago...
HURLEY, Is someone shooting at us?
HURLEY, You must be the French chick. 
HURLEY," Hurley. I, uh -- Sayid? That guy you tortured, he..."
HURLEY," Look, I came here to find --  oh, easy, easy, easy. I'm just getting your notes. Please, tell me why you wrote this. What do these numbers mean? Please. "
HURLEY," What? You don't know? Okay, that thing in the woods, maybe it's a monster, maybe it's a pissed off giraffe, I don't know! The fact that no one is even looking for us, yeah, that's weird, but I just go along with it because I'm along for the ride, good old fun time Hurley! Well guess what? Now, I want some friggin' answers! "
HURLEY, There's a radio tower on this Island? 
HURLEY, The distress signal we heard?
HURLEY, But the numbers -- did you ever find out anything about them? Do you know where they got their power?
HURLEY," They bring bad stuff to everyone around you. They're cursed. You know that, right? The numbers, they're cursed. "
HURLEY," Thank you. Thank you. You have no idea how long I've been waiting for someone to agree with me. Thank you. Oh god, thank you."
HURLEY,  Go where?
HURLEY,"  Need a battery?  She says, hey."
HURLEY," When you find a laundromat, let me know."
HURLEY, I think the plane crash might have been my fault.
HURLEY," Hey, before we came here a lot of bad stuff used to happen whenever I was around."
HURLEY," Yeah, that's -- that would be kind of a mellow way of describing it. "
HURLEY," Dude, you gotta let me finish."
HURLEY, What?
HURLEY, Okay. Back home I'm worth 156 million dollars.
HURLEY, Dude.
HURLEY,"  Dude, it looks like someone steam rolled Harry Potter. "
HURLEY, What happened?
HURLEY, But he was with Locke. 
HURLEY, No -- first class -- mesh - I'm cool. Lord in heaven.
HURLEY,  Jack.
HURLEY," Whoa, dude. You alright, man? You're looking kind of goth."
HURLEY," The beach, I think."
HURLEY, What for?
HURLEY," Dude, it's washed -- washed the spider out. Unless it's some kind of British version?"
HURLEY," What's the matter, man? "
HURLEY, Maybe it's hungry?
HURLEY," Any deposits? You know, diaper-wise?"
HURLEY," Alright, it's time to break out the big guns.  Dude, that's all I got."
HURLEY," I'm on bamboo duty, but yeah, sometimes I help refill the water. "
HURLEY," Well, they fight like a married couple building a raft together..."
HURLEY," Oh, because of Kate?"
HURLEY," Yeah, I guess she wants on the raft. So Sawyer went off on Michael because, you know, he gets to decide who goes. Hey, you don't think Kate did it, do you?"
HURLEY," Well, you know, the whole fugitive thing. "
HURLEY," He doesn't know?  Well how am I supposed to keep straight who knows what around here? I mean, Steve didn't even know about the polar bear. "
HURLEY, Dude. Whoa. 
HURLEY," Uh, question -- how do we know we can all, like, fit in there?"
HURLEY," Well, that's 3 reasons to go right there. "
HURLEY, Here you go. 
HURLEY, Don't look at it. 
HURLEY, Dude! Do not look at it. 
HURLEY," Good luck, dude.  Keep dry, kiddo."
HURLEY," Let me ask you something, Arnzt. "
HURLEY, Arnzt.
HURLEY," Sorry, man, the name's hard to pronounce. "
HURLEY, How about I just call you by your first name? 
HURLEY, Why not? I remember it from the plane's manifest. I think Leslie's a bitchin' name. 
HURLEY, What are you...
HURLEY," Dude, we've got to book. "
HURLEY," Uh, where's Arnzt?"
HURLEY," Dude, I thought you were dead. "
HURLEY," 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. 4, 8, we're dead, 15, doomed and dead, 16, 23, 42..."
HURLEY," Huh? Yeah, awesome. I just have to pee.  Great idea, dude, go look into the burning death hole."
HURLEY," Yes, good idea. Let's do that."
HURLEY," Why'd you do that? Why'd you light the fuse, man?"
HURLEY," Ah, maybe because I was running towards you, waving my arms, yelling ""don't do that?"""
HURLEY," You should go ahead, man -- don't want Locke making time with your girl.  Joke, dude."
HURLEY," Really? Wow, usually you're, like, Mr. Haha.  There you go. Life's not so bad, right? I mean, sure the Others are coming to, like, eat us all -- and every once in a while someone blows up all over you, but you do get to sleep in every morning."
HURLEY, What?
HURLEY," Yeah, that's kind of a long story."
HURLEY, You'll think I'm crazy.
HURLEY," Awhile ago I was in this kind of psych ward, and there was this guy, Leonard -- and all the time I knew him all he ever said were these numbers -- 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 -- over and over and over again. And they kind of got stuck in my head. So, when I got out -- well, actually a couple of months after I got out -- I was buying a frozen burrito and I thought, hey, I should play the lottery. And I guess those numbers were still stuck in my head so I played them. And I won 114 million dollars. That's when it started happening -- my grandpa died, my house caught on fire, the chicken joint that I worked at got hit by a meteor -- well, actually meteorite. Okay, so tonight I see the same freaking numbers on the hatch thing -- just written on the side -- and that's why I tried to stop it -- because that thing is cursed, man."
HURLEY, I'm not crazy.
HURLEY," So, what? That's it? That's all?"
HURLEY," How about you believe me, man?"
HURLEY, What's that thing where doctors make you feel better just by talking to you?
HURLEY," Yeah, that. Yours sucks, dude."
HURLEY," You're kidding, right? You're going back? "
HURLEY, What about all that stuff you said about waiting 'til morning and watching the sun rise?
HURLEY," You're kidding, right? You're going back?"
HURLEY, What about all that stuff you said about waiting 'til morning and watching the sun rise?! 
HURLEY," Here! Dude, I've got to say, I didn't think we were going to get through the night. And I wasn't even here for that baby stealing part."
HURLEY, It's about time things are finally returning to normalness.
HURLEY," Uh, crap."
HURLEY, Dude.
HURLEY," Cool, okay, great. What's a conduit line? "
HURLEY, Whoa!
HURLEY," Uh, uh, depends on what you mean by it?"
HURLEY," Oh, what's that?"
HURLEY, What code?
HURLEY, Wait a minute...
HURLEY," Dude, I'm serious, stop."
HURLEY," Yeah, well, I think it is."
HURLEY, What is this thing? You don't even know what it does! I mean we need...
HURLEY," You know what? Forget it, go ahead, do your thing."
HURLEY," Jin, you're here."
HURLEY," Dude, you speak English."
HURLEY, 나? Subtitle
HURLEY, 저 친구 여기서 뭐하는거야? Subtitle
HURLEY, 뭐? Subtitle
HURLEY," No, I was just -- resting my eyes."
HURLEY," Yeah, I remember the Numbers. "
HURLEY, Awesome.
HURLEY, Hurray for us. 
HURLEY," Stop, ow, ow, mom, stop. I just slipped."
HURLEY," Mom, I'm fine. "
HURLEY, I'm not lying. 
HURLEY, It must be something I ate.
HURLEY, I do exercise.
HURLEY, Maybe I don't want to change. Maybe I like my life. 
HURLEY, Spill what?
HURLEY," Uh, nothing, really. "
HURLEY," Well, I guess it's kind of like a bunker, you know, from WWII, only newer. "
HURLEY, I don't know. 
HURLEY," Well, I guess someone told me."
HURLEY," Dude, look, I'd never lie."
HURLEY, It's 156 million.
HURLEY," Hey, Rose."
HURLEY," So, doing laundry, huh?"
HURLEY, Don't you want to know what happened?
HURLEY," You know, out there. Everyone's asking me what's in the Hatch."
HURLEY, Don't you want to know? 
HURLEY," Well, actually, it sort of is."
HURLEY, It's around here somewhere.
HURLEY, Uh-huh.
HURLEY, It's kind of a long story. 
HURLEY," No one. I swear. Dude, it's a big job. I needed -- help."
HURLEY, She's cool. She won't tell anyone.
HURLEY," Inventory of all of it, and figure out how we make it last. "
HURLEY, You don't want to know.
HURLEY, DHARMA Initiative Salad Dressing - Ranch composite. Sounds tasty.
HURLEY, Apollo bars? Ever hear of these?
HURLEY," Bernard, that was your husband?"
HURLEY," Oh, but, I thought he was in the back of the plane.  I'm sorry, I didn't mean..."
HURLEY," Everyone's going to hate me, Rose."
HURLEY," Well, that'll change."
HURLEY," Uh, Kate, you can't take..."
HURLEY, That's where it starts.
HURLEY,"  Yeah, I'm fine. "
HURLEY," Uh, no."
HURLEY," Uh, yeah?"
HURLEY, I didn't eat 8 pieces!
HURLEY," Dude, I quit."
HURLEY," Oh, my god. Oh, my god."
HURLEY," I'm, I'm fine."
HURLEY, You should get back in there or he'll have you scrubbing johns for the rest of the week.
HURLEY, What?
HURLEY," Hey, I've been -- around. "
HURLEY, You know what?
HURLEY," Yeah, well, Locke's lying."
HURLEY, It's not going to explode!
HURLEY," Look, Jack put me in charge. Look, I don't even want..."
HURLEY, What?
HURLEY," Uh, yeah. A couple jars. "
HURLEY," No can do, man."
HURLEY, It's not like that.
HURLEY, One of them? 
HURLEY, I'm going to go check out the headphones.
HURLEY, Star-la.
HURLEY, I did.
HURLEY,"  Hey, can I try those on?"
HURLEY,"  So, Starla!"
HURLEY," Sorry. Uh, well, The Hold Steady is playing the Troubadour this weekend, and I was wondering -- maybe Friday..."
HURLEY," Oh, no, I didn't mean..."
HURLEY," Yeah, that's totally cool."
HURLEY," Nothing, I just wanted to ask her out before..."
HURLEY, Nothing.
HURLEY," Why'd you tell Charlie, man?"
HURLEY," Yeah, well you shouldn't have. You should have listened to me about coming down here, period. Now it's all going to change, everything."
HURLEY," You know, people say that, but it's not true, man. Trust me, I know. And guess who gets to be the bad guy who has to say no you can't have peanut butter for the cute blonde and her poor Island baby. You know who? It's me. -- You know what? I'm not going to do it. Find someone else to deal with the chow, man."
HURLEY," I don't want to do this, man!"
HURLEY," Okay, then. "
HURLEY," Dude, I am!"
HURLEY," Yeah, I got it."
HURLEY," Okay, we're good."
HURLEY," A little to the left, dude, and more of an angle."
HURLEY,"  Dude, what are you doing?"
HURLEY," Dude, promise me something. "
HURLEY," Promise me that no matter what happens, we'll never change -- this will never change."
HURLEY, I'm not getting surgery.
HURLEY," Listen, Johnny, I'm serious. Promise me that you and I will always stay the same."
HURLEY," Uh, it's dynamite."
HURLEY," I'm sorry, but I can't let it happen again."
HURLEY," Dude, we shouldn't go here. Dude, let's go, they jack the prices here. "
HURLEY," Look, just get out of here, Rose."
HURLEY," Not if I do it from outside the door. It's thick, and I'll make sure there's nobody around first. So, please, will you just go?"
HURLEY, You don't get it! This is going to mess it all up!
HURLEY," Let me tell you something, Rose! We were all fine before we had any  potato chips! But now we've got these potato chips and everybody's going to want them! So Steve gets them, and Charlie's pissed -- but he's not pissed at Steve, he's pissed at me!"
HURLEY," And I'm going to be in the middle of it! And then it's going to be well, what about us -- why didn't I get any potato chips? C'mon, help us out, Hurley. Why did you give Kate the shampoo? And why didn't I get the peanut butter? Then, they'll get really mad and start asking why does Hugo have everything -- why should he get to decide?  Then they'll all hate me. I don't know what to do."
HURLEY," Come on, Jack. The inventory's done, this is the only way."
HURLEY," Dude, there's enough food in there to feed one guy, 3 meals a day for another 3 months. We have 40 people, it's just not going to work. You put me in charge, this is what we're doing."
HURLEY, Okay? 
HURLEY,  Okay. 
HURLEY," All you've got to do is retrace your steps. Like, what'd you do yesterday?"
HURLEY," Whoa, you fed the dog?  Bingo!"
HURLEY," So, Seoul. Is that in the good Korea or the bad Korea?"
HURLEY, Did you go to the Olympics? 
HURLEY," Dude, dogs will eat anything. When I was a kid, my dog, Buster -- I had this drawer where I'd throw in all my change, right -- and I guess there were some Smarties in there -- so, like, the next day, Buster craps out a buck thirty-five in nickels.  Did you ever own a dog? "
HURLEY, What was his name?
HURLEY, Bpo Bpo -- that mean something?
HURLEY, A kiss.
HURLEY," Um, tell me again why we're doing this here when there's a dryer in the hatch?"
HURLEY," Oh, it's because of the doomsday button, isn't it?"
HURLEY,"  Yeah, spoiled."
HURLEY, What kind of stuff?
HURLEY, I think their stuff's still on the beach back where their tent is.
HURLEY," Past the hanging tree, double or nothing."
HURLEY," Dude, double or nothing, there's no way you're hitting it that far."
HURLEY," Ignore him, he's an idiot."
HURLEY, Crap!
HURLEY," Hey.  So, Rose's husband's white. Didn't see that one coming."
HURLEY," No, just taking a walk, thought I'd say hey. -- Who's taking care of Sawyer? "
HURLEY," So, you're like, mad at him? "
HURLEY," Maybe because he's the one that always comes down here and chops wood, and now you are? It's like, transference. "
HURLEY," Well, that's what they call it in the mental hospital."
HURLEY," Yo, Sawyer, glad you're back, man."
HURLEY," Hey. Cool hat, dude. "
HURLEY," Uh, yeah. I guess Michael took off."
HURLEY," He stole some guns and he went all commando. He said he was going after Walt. Later dudes, gotta get to the hatch."
HURLEY, Geronimo Jackson? 
HURLEY,  This looks sweet. Let's give her a rip.
HURLEY, So what do you think's the story with that Libby chick? 
HURLEY," She's kind of cute, right? You know, in a I've-been-terrorized-by-the-Others-for-40-days kind of way."
HURLEY," I think I have a chance with her. I mean, it's the classic desert island scenario. If I ever had a shot, this is it."
HURLEY," Dude, it's been a day."
HURLEY," We can change it, dude. Did you ever hear of Geronimo Jackson? "
HURLEY," Oh, they went after Michael."
HURLEY," Everyone -- Jack, Sawyer, Locke. Oh, and Kate. "
HURLEY," Uh, Sawyer, when you were over there across the Island how well did you get to know those Tailies? "
HURLEY," That Libby chick seems pretty cool. I mean, is she?"
HURLEY," Nah, just asking."
HURLEY,  Forget it.
HURLEY, Charlie? What are you doing?
HURLEY," What are you doing, man?"
HURLEY, It's the middle of the night. What are you doing with the baby?
HURLEY, It's okay! We're over here!
HURLEY," Stick? I don't know, dude. Don't you need 21? I think you should hit."
HURLEY, How do you know that?
HURLEY, Why?
HURLEY, I'm kind of waiting for my moment.
HURLEY, It washes clothes. That's all I need to know. 
HURLEY,  Do I know you from somewhere?
HURLEY, Flight? 
HURLEY, Huh?
HURLEY," Oh, oh, sure, go ahead."
HURLEY, I did?
HURLEY, It's awesome. 
HURLEY," Hey, man. You gonna put the lime in the coconut, drink 'em both up?  Lime in the coconut? The song?"
HURLEY," So, I'm over at Rose and Bernard's tent. Did you know he's a dentist? Well, that's not all he's been holding out on us. The guy picked up Boone's signal from the Norwegian plane. "
HURLEY," Right. Anyhow, he picked it up with this. "
HURLEY," Yeah, but can't you switch a blue wire with a red wire -- make it stronger. "
HURLEY," Come on, man, I mean, it's worth..."
HURLEY," Just trying to cheer you up, dude. "
HURLEY," Okay, man. Sorry. No problem."
HURLEY," Hey, check this out. I found a manuscript in one of the suitcases. It's like a mystery book. "
HURLEY," Cool, you fixed it!"
HURLEY," Static's good, right?"
HURLEY," Wait, what's that?!"
HURLEY," Oh, crap. "
HURLEY," Hold it, stop! Do you hear that?!"
HURLEY," Whoa, you hear how clear that is? It's got to be close, right? "
HURLEY," Or, anytime. -- Just kidding, dude. "
HURLEY, Nothing. 
HURLEY," Well, actually in the back it says it'll keep at room temperature for up to 7 years. "
HURLEY," Please, dude, you can't tell."
HURLEY," Come on, man, please?"
HURLEY," Dude, it's just a tree frog. "
HURLEY, Yeah.
HURLEY, This is how people get killed in scary movies. 
HURLEY, It's Babar.
HURLEY," Fine, go ahead. Tell everyone the fat guy's been hiding ranch dressing -- the fat guy likes to eat. Yeah, I'm fat. Fat, fat, fat, fat, fat. You think I don't know that? At least people like me. You know what? Find the damn frog by yourself. "
HURLEY, There it is.
HURLEY," Dude, nice catch."
HURLEY," It kind of reminds me of a turtle I once had. Its name was Stuart. It ran off when I was 10. Well, that's what mom said. I kind of think she threw him out. "
HURLEY," I have an idea. Why don't I take him -- far from here -- 2 beaches away? Then maybe he'll find a Mrs. Tree Frog. That way he won't keep you up anymore, and everyone's happy. "
HURLEY, Dude.
HURLEY," Hey, guys."
HURLEY," Hey, Sun. Look what I found in the middle of the jungle. It's not even melted or nothing. Crazy, huh? You want to split it? "
HURLEY," Okay, well, later, dude. "
HURLEY, She took off into the jungle with Charlie and Sayid yesterday.
HURLEY," Well, that would, like, assume that anyone actually tells me anything. Maybe if I were in the loop I could be more helpful."
HURLEY,"  Loop, dude, loop."
HURLEY, I bet 4 papayas. 
HURLEY," Dude, I got a killer hand, here."
HURLEY, But you don't even know...
HURLEY," Dude, you got me."
HURLEY," Whoa, dude."
HURLEY," But, I want to..."
HURLEY, Jack and Sawyer are finally going to beat each other up.
HURLEY, I kind of prefer breathing.
HURLEY," Wow, I can -- I can see why. "
HURLEY, I guess I need to drop a few pounds.
HURLEY, It's not my metabolism. I'm sick. 
HURLEY, Never mind. 
HURLEY," Okay, but it's bad."
HURLEY," When we first crashed here, I thought, this isn't all bad -- it's, like, the all mango diet. I wasn't turning any heads or nothing but I did drop a couple belt sizes. Then we found this hatch and it was full of food -- tons of food. I tried giving it all away, but I guess I kind of kept some of it for myself. I wish I could just get rid of it. "
HURLEY, I feel free.
HURLEY, No.
HURLEY, No.
HURLEY," No. No way! Not me, no! Not again, no!"
HURLEY, Hey! Hey!!
HURLEY, Uh-oh.
HURLEY, Nothing. 
HURLEY, No one.
HURLEY, I kind of -- don't want to talk about it. 
HURLEY, How about that? 
HURLEY, Proud of me for what?
HURLEY, It's okay. I had a salad and some chicken breast for lunch.
HURLEY, It was good.
HURLEY, Nah. I know she put me in here for a reason. 
HURLEY, The accident.
HURLEY, Do we have to?
HURLEY, I was never really good at homework.
HURLEY, Nobody else did it. 
HURLEY," Well, Dave didn't do it. He said it was a stupid idea."
HURLEY," Dave's the most normal person in this place, man. "
HURLEY, Nothing.
HURLEY," Brooks said you're, like, negative."
HURLEY," Nah, I don't know, it's just..."
HURLEY, Like what? 
HURLEY," Yeah, I guess I could eat. "
HURLEY, You're not here!
HURLEY," Hey, wait!"
HURLEY," Wait, Dave!"
HURLEY," Did either of you see a guy run through here -- in a bathrobe, with a coconut?"
HURLEY,"  Yeah, me either. "
HURLEY," Uh, dude."
HURLEY,"  They're just numbers, man. "
HURLEY, It's my mid-afternoon snack. 
HURLEY," Thank you, nurse Lazenby. "
HURLEY," What do mean, get out of here?"
HURLEY, Dr. Brooks says...
HURLEY, Clonazepam. 
HURLEY," No, me and Dave were just, you know, talking about stuff."
HURLEY, Okay. 
HURLEY, Cheese.
HURLEY," Nope, I'm good."
HURLEY, Dude.
HURLEY,  You've got to twist it to get the frosting. Pulling it will only break the cookie. 
HURLEY, I'm kind of looking for something. 
HURLEY," Well, actually, I was sort of hoping you'd do me a favor. Remember when I helped you out with that tree frog -- that you killed?"
HURLEY, I sort of -- need some medicine.
HURLEY, It's called Clonazepam. 
HURLEY," So you can calm down. Or, for when you're seeing things that aren't supposed to be there. "
HURLEY," I don't know, maybe like a bald guy in a bathrobe. "
HURLEY, Who the hell do you think you are?!
HURLEY,  Pork Rinds! Barbar! Jabba! Stay Puft!
HURLEY,  Mongo! Lardo!
HURLEY, I'm not crazy. -- I'm not crazy.
HURLEY, I don't want to talk about it.
HURLEY," I guess you know what happened, then. "
HURLEY," I don't want to talk, okay!"
HURLEY, What?
HURLEY," Well, I'm going to need a lot of protein where I'm going."
HURLEY," Back to the caves. No one lives there anymore, so I won't bother anybody. I'm just going to live alone and be one of those guys -- you know, the crazy guys -- with a big beard and no clothes who's naked and throws doodie at people."
HURLEY, Just leave me alone. You can't help me. No one can. 
HURLEY, You're not here. You were in the hospital. You can't be here. 
HURLEY," I like that I have a good relationship with my mom. I like making my grandpa, Tito, laugh. I like chicken. "
HURLEY, I like that I like chicken?
HURLEY, Kind of -- I think I messed up some spelling. 
HURLEY," It's not like... I can't really do anything about it, right?  If I, uh -- if I w -- wasn't so fat, they never would have died. "
HURLEY," Yeah, but I did walk out there. And it did collapse. I killed them."
HURLEY, That was my fault. 
HURLEY," Dave's right about you. You know, you're nothing but a quack. "
HURLEY," You know, Dave cares about me. He's my friend."
HURLEY," Wait, you're not -- you're a hallucination.  Ow."
HURLEY, Maybe I just imagined you slapped me?  Ow! Damn it. 
HURLEY," Dr. Brooks showed me a picture from the rec room. My arm was around, like, nothingness. "
HURLEY, No. 
HURLEY, I don't think I can do this. I'm sorry.
HURLEY, You're not real. You're trying to get me to run away and get cheeseburgers because I want cheeseburgers. 
HURLEY," No, man. I'm just not coming. Look, you don't want me to get better. You don't want me to change. "
HURLEY," No, I'm not. You just want me to stay fat. You don't want me to get better. You wouldn't care if I ate myself to death. "
HURLEY," Bye, Dave. "
HURLEY, Worse?
HURLEY," Yeah, I realized you were imaginary. "
HURLEY," And that was a breakthrough. And a little while later Brooks let me out, and I went home to live with my mom, and I got my job at Mr. Clucks back. And I got better."
HURLEY, What?
HURLEY, That's -- not possible.
HURLEY," No. I had my mom, my friend Johnny -- I won the lottery. "
HURLEY, The Hatch?
HURLEY, But I got better. I changed.
HURLEY," I just destroyed my stash, and I've been exercising. Libby says it won't happen over night. "
HURLEY, So this is all in my brain?
HURLEY, So I'm making you up?
HURLEY, What part of me are you? 
HURLEY, It?
HURLEY, I don't want to kill myself.
HURLEY," So, if I -- all this will be gone? I'll just wake up?"
HURLEY, Dave!!
HURLEY, Dave!
HURLEY, What are you doing here?
HURLEY, How'd you know where I was?
HURLEY, Hah! Jin doesn't speak English!
HURLEY," No! You're just a part of me that's scared. You don't want me to wake up. Well, guess what? I'm not scared."
HURLEY, Like me? You don't know me.
HURLEY," Yeah, well did you know I'm so fat that I killed 2 people? And that I have an imaginary friend? "
HURLEY," No, I'm not, because this isn't happening! None of it! I'm just imagining it! This isn't real life! "
HURLEY," Because in real life -- no girl like you would ever like me. Remember when I said I knew you from somewhere? Well, maybe it's because I made you up?"
HURLEY, I don't know.
HURLEY, When you saw me on the beach this morning was I holding a slipper? 
HURLEY, Maybe you should do it one more time just to be sure.
HURLEY," Do you really think I can, you know, change?"
HURLEY, Cheese.
HURLEY, Nope. I'm good. 
HURLEY, No way. I'm on a new diet. Nothing but fish and water; and fish and water. 
HURLEY, Talking to your wife.
HURLEY, Neil?
HURLEY," Dude, we, like, built a raft. But it got blown up. "
HURLEY," Dude, we're, like, going to need a lot more rocks. "
HURLEY," Hey, um, I can sketch the letters. "
HURLEY, I think he's not so crazy about the whole carry the rocks a half mile thing. 
HURLEY," Dude, nice hole."
HURLEY," Hey, man, remember that radio we made? I'm thinking maybe I could get it to play some music. You know, for Libby."
HURLEY," Here's the thing -- even that would be good -- because then Libby would be like, ""it's the thought that counts"" -- and I'll score major points. Especially when she sees me holding it over my head."
HURLEY," They didn't have ""Say Anything"" in Baghdad? It's awesome. This dude, like, gets his boom box and he holds it over his head outside this chick's window and he plays some Peter Gabriel song for her and bam, the girl's, like, his. I mean, after her dad goes to jail. But then he gets her. "
HURLEY," You should really check it out sometime. I mean, if we ever, you know, get off this island."
HURLEY, You think she'd like that? 
HURLEY, This isn't what it looks like. 
HURLEY," It looks like something that... it's not. Aw, man. I'm so busted."
HURLEY," Naw, I'm not busted for that. I'm busted for something else. I was packing a picnic because I was kind of hoping that you'd want to go with me. You know, as an 'us' thing. But, it was a surprise. "
HURLEY," So, you want to go?"
HURLEY, Can that part still be a surprise? 
HURLEY, Watch your head. Almost there. 
HURLEY," Sure, I used to watch it all the time when I was in the hospital -- when I broke my hip. "
HURLEY," Uh, that's a different tree."
HURLEY," Dude, I'm not lost. Will you trust me?  We're right about to walk on the most excellent secret beach on the Island, and -- surprise! "
HURLEY, Blankets?
HURLEY," Oh, wine. Groovy. Hey, maybe if I get drunk enough I'll remember where I know you from. "
HURLEY," Hey guys, you seen Libby around?"
HURLEY,  We were going to have our first date. 
HURLEY," Yeah, a picnic on the beach. I'm glad you're okay, man."
HURLEY," Can, can I talk to her? "
HURLEY,"  Hey, it's Hurley. Hugo. I'm sorry I forgot the blankets. I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.  Libby? "
HURLEY,"  They're dead! Ana Lucia and Libby are dead. I mean, we haven't even buried them yet. "
HURLEY, Why would I want to go?
HURLEY," I'm sorry about Walt, dude. But I'm not coming."
HURLEY," Libby was -- she was -- she -- Libby was a psychologist, or psychiatrist -- one of those. Either way, she probably helped a lot of people. She helped me. She was my friend. It's not fair that this happened to her. It's not.  I'm going with you. Goodbye, Libby. "
HURLEY, What do you mean a trap?
HURLEY, No way. I'm not even going to kill someone. 
HURLEY, I thought the point was to get Walt back?
HURLEY, Did that bird just say my name? 
HURLEY, No thanks; I'm not hungry.
HURLEY," Prosthetic, dude."
HURLEY, Did you kill them? Ana Lucia and Libby? Did you? 
HURLEY," But if you did have time—you still would have killed her, right?"
HURLEY, I'm going back.
HURLEY, We're all going to get killed and you knew it! You let us come anyway.
HURLEY, What are they? 
HURLEY, What? 
HURLEY, But what about my friends?
HURLEY, Dude.
HURLEY," They kept Jack, Kate and Sawyer. And they sent me back to tell everyone else that we can't ever go over there. Oh, and that dude we had in the hatch, Henry -- he was there. He's, like, their leader.  So, what do we do?"
HURLEY, You're not going to do anything?
HURLEY," Wait, where are you guys going? "
HURLEY, Save him from what? 
HURLEY, Bear? What bear?
HURLEY, Bear? Is that you? Who's there? 
HURLEY," Uh, yeah. "
HURLEY, Whoa! Dude! I'm not alone.
HURLEY, What happened to yours?
HURLEY," So, like, the hatch blew off your underwear?"
HURLEY," No, no, that's okay. I've got something in here.  How do you feel about tie-dye?"
HURLEY," So, when you say ""turn the key"" you mean like key, key? "
HURLEY, That seems kind of convenient.
HURLEY," I'm just saying, if you had this magic key the whole time why didn't you, like, use it?"
HURLEY, So what did happen? 
HURLEY, You didn't implode. 
HURLEY," You're not going to, like, turn into the Hulk, or something.  So is that what made the blender noise? And the sky turn purple? "
HURLEY," Right, you were failsafing. Well, FYI, the whole island vibrated. And Kate and Jack and Sawyer saw it, too, right before they got bags pulled over their heads."
HURLEY, What? What speech? All he said was he was going to go save Eko and kill bears.
HURLEY,  Is he alive?
HURLEY, Jack's not coming back. They've got him.
HURLEY, Whoa.
HURLEY," I just got hit with, you know, deja vu. "
HURLEY, Is that -- art?
HURLEY, Okay. You want some fruit salad?
HURLEY, Why's that?
HURLEY, Couple of days now. 
HURLEY," Come on. Locke will want to know you guys are back.  Stay alive dude, ok? "
HURLEY, You guys smell smoke? 
HURLEY," Eko. Eko, come on!"
HURLEY, We gotta get you outta here! 
HURLEY," Come on, Eko. "
HURLEY," It's hot, Eko! Careful! "
HURLEY," No luck, dudes. We looked everywhere. Eko's gone."
HURLEY," Not that we, like, know what a trail looks like. "
HURLEY, What do you mean 'Anybody want to come along?' 
HURLEY," Yeah, see, Jack would go and do stuff alone. Or he'd take Sayid or Kate. "
HURLEY," Dude, I don't know about this."
HURLEY," He would want us to ransack his tent and take his stash? Yeah, that sounds exactly like Sawyer."
HURLEY,"  Oh, Desmundo. "
HURLEY, You guys find Eko?
HURLEY,"  Dude, you okay? Hey guys, what's wrong with Desmond? "
HURLEY," I'll tell you how he knew -- that guy sees the future, dude. "
HURLEY, Locke doesn't know about anything except knives and fishing. 
HURLEY," You do realize he's going to know your plan before you even come up with it, dude. "
HURLEY,"  Say it, dude."
HURLEY," Hey, do you know any songs about drinking and fighting and girls with one leg?"
HURLEY, Oh no you didn't. You were like a mile away. 
HURLEY, Dude. 
HURLEY," So then, the Others take the bags off our heads and we're, like, on the other side of the island. And they take Jack, Kate and Sawyer someplace and they sent me back to warn everyone to stay away. Which I did. And now everyone's freaked out. With them gone -- and what happened to Eko -- they're all scared. And I'm scared. But then, I've been scared most of my time here anyway, except when I'm with you. I miss you, Libby."
HURLEY," Dude, you okay?"
HURLEY, Really? Because you've kind of been moping...
HURLEY, You can tell me anything.
HURLEY, I think he might be right. And I think it might be my fault.
HURLEY," I'm kind of cursed. Death finds me, dude."
HURLEY," Here, Vincent. Come here.  I think we need to get that."
HURLEY," Okay, if I'm not back in 3 hours tell somebody."
HURLEY," Vincent! Vincent, come here. Vincent."
HURLEY, Awesome.
HURLEY,"  Uh, I like chicken."
HURLEY," Actually, I've kind of had some bad luck, too. My grandpa Tito died of a heart attack and the first house I bought my mom burnt down. My friend Johnny ran off with my girlfriend, Starla. Oh, and this guy jumped off my accountant's roof."
HURLEY," Yeah. Sorry, Tricia Tanaka."
HURLEY," Oh, I don't know."
HURLEY,"  Hey, you sure it's okay?"
HURLEY, The safety guards are on the fryers?
HURLEY, Do you hear something?
HURLEY, Hey! Hey! Hey everyone! Hey!!
HURLEY,  Car! I found a car tipped over in the jungle.
HURLEY," And we could totally fix it and get it going again. It's not far, come on."
HURLEY," Because it'll be fun.  We could all use some fun. I mean, after everything's that happened we need it.  Especially you, dude. So who's with me?!!"
HURLEY, Come on. Anyone. We're going to drive it! Who's coming?!
HURLEY," Thanks, dude.  You have no idea what you volunteered for, do you?  Come on."
HURLEY, Tricia Tanaka is dead.
HURLEY," Mr. Clucks got hit by a meteor, or an asteroid. I don't know the difference but it's gone."
HURLEY," It's not crazy. It's the lottery money, the numbers, I'm cursed. And now Tricia Tanaka's dead, and her camera dude, and it's all my fault.  Ow!!"
HURLEY, It's not an accident. It is a curse. There's only one way to stop it. I have to go to Australia.
HURLEY," That's where the numbers came from. Lenny, in the institution, he told me."
HURLEY, You can?
HURLEY," Poor, Roger. Sorry about your arm, dude."
HURLEY, Totally. Let's check it out. 
HURLEY," Dude, Roger was on a beer run."
HURLEY, I suck at charades. You want to what?
HURLEY," Oh, you want to take Roger out?  And turn it over.  I understand!"
HURLEY," Okay, on 3. 1-2-3."
HURLEY, We'll get that later.
HURLEY," Oh, I got it. You're going to tip it up. Crafty."
HURLEY," Yeah, crafty. It's like, when you're good at ... crafts. Nevermind."
HURLEY,  Dude! You're alive!! You're alive.
HURLEY," Pretty cool, huh?"
HURLEY, What about Jack and Kate? Are they with you? Are they alright?
HURLEY, Okay. It's okay. It's going to be alright. Jack's going to be alright. We all are.
HURLEY," Naw, see, things are getting better. The car, you coming back safely -- it's a sign."
HURLEY, Uh-uh. You're going to help us fix this thing.
HURLEY, Because there's beer.
HURLEY, My father? You're acting like he never left us -- like he hasn't been gone for 17 years. And all the sudden he shows up? Are you at least a little suspicious?
HURLEY, What?!
HURLEY, I'm not crazy. And the only reason he's back is because he wants the money.
HURLEY," Well, guess what? There isn't going to be any money. Mr. Tranh? Lady Tranh? Your services will no longer be needed.  Severance. Trust me, I'm doing you a huge favor. It's only a matter of time before the curse gets you, and you die, or worse."
HURLEY," Getting rid of it. All of it -- the money, the houses, the livestock -- and I'm starting with him."
HURLEY, He's staying with us? Where?
HURLEY, What's been 17 years?
HURLEY,  No! No! No! This can't be happening. He has to go! He has to. I want him gone!
HURLEY," Yeah, I do."
HURLEY," You got me, dude."
HURLEY," Looks good to me. Engine's fine, right?"
HURLEY," Oh, that's just Roger.  I'm going to start the car now."
HURLEY," Dude, even if you were speaking English, I wouldn't understand a word you were saying. Just relax; we're good. This'll work."
HURLEY, I have hope. This will work.
HURLEY,  Damn it.
HURLEY,  Can you get it to work? Do you know what's wrong?
HURLEY," Dude, that beer's been sitting there since before Rocky III, maybe even II. It's probably poison by now."
HURLEY," That's not cool, dude. That guy had a mom, a family, and friends. Oh, and a name, it's not skeletor, it's Roger Workman."
HURLEY," Yeah, well you should still respect the dead."
HURLEY," Whoa, whoa, whoa, can you fix it?"
HURLEY," But you have to! Can't you try, dude? I mean, we've got to get this thing running."
HURLEY," What's your problem, man? Why don't you want this to work?"
HURLEY, Because we could all use a little hope.
HURLEY, It's for the noise.
HURLEY, That is disgusting.
HURLEY, I'm not going anywhere with you.
HURLEY," What ""one thing?"""
HURLEY, This is stupid.
HURLEY, You could have seen that on the news.
HURLEY, What numbers?
HURLEY, Why? What is it?
HURLEY, My clothes?
HURLEY, Did my dad put you up to this?
HURLEY, I'll give you a thousand dollars right now if you admit that my dad told you to say this stuff.
HURLEY," 10,000."
HURLEY, Help who?
HURLEY, I'm praying.
HURLEY, Help.
HURLEY," Dude. Hey, dude, stop moping. Come on."
HURLEY, Uh-uh. When people stare out at the ocean and get all quiet-like? They're moping. So get up and come with me. That car I found? We're getting it running.
HURLEY," Snap out of it! Stop feeling sorry for yourself because someone said you're going to die. I've got an idea that's going to help us both.  Now, it is dangerous. And there's a very good chance that you will die."
HURLEY," It is. Because if you don't die, then we win."
HURLEY," Look, I don't know about you, but things have really sucked for me lately and I could use a victory. So let's get one, dude. Let's get this car started. Let's look death in the face and say, ""whatever, man."" Let's make our own luck. What do you say?"
HURLEY,  Come on. Get up; we've got work to do.
HURLEY, Shut up! Red -- neck -- man.
HURLEY, We need another man.
HURLEY," To push this car, dude."
HURLEY, I'd really like you to leave.
HURLEY," Well, you're not getting any of it."
HURLEY, What?
HURLEY, I'll send you a postcard from Sydney. 
HURLEY, We're going to jumpstart it. You guys are going to push it. And then on the way down I'm going to pop the clutch and get it started.
HURLEY," Dudes, I know how to drive. Now come on, just push me. This'll work; I know it."
HURLEY,  Are you sure you want to do this?
HURLEY, Push!
HURLEY," Oh, jeez."
HURLEY, There is no curse. You make your own luck.
HURLEY, You make your own luck. There is no curse!
HURLEY," Jin found it when he was out looking for firewood. We made legs for it, paddles, now all we need is a ball."
HURLEY, It must've landed in the jungle when the hatch exploded.
HURLEY," Look, dude, all I know is the sky turned purple. After that I don't ask questions. Just make myself a salad and move on."
HURLEY, Wow. She's not back yet? Hmm.  You guys find anything we could use as a ball?
HURLEY," Cool, the ball. "
HURLEY, Play ping pong?
HURLEY, If you lose?
HURLEY, Yep. Are we playing with the mercy rule?
HURLEY," Yeah, if I am like up 11-0 I, you know, automatically win."
HURLEY," Well, any one of us."
HURLEY, Wanna volley for serve?
HURLEY, 0 serving 0.
HURLEY, 1-Nothing
HURLEY," Sorry I beat you so bad, dude."
HURLEY, My mom had a table in her basement. And I played a lot at the instit— this place I hung out at. And I got kinda good.
HURLEY, Looks like that last slam didn’t cause any long-term damage to your forehead. And you got three points which is better than nothing.
HURLEY, I came to give you back your stuff.  Cause I know you're the kind of guy who needs stuff.
HURLEY," She'll be ok, dude- Kate. I know you're worried about her. But she's with Locke and Sayid. She's going to be fine."
HURLEY, Uh uh. It's Hurley. Or Hugo if you want.
HURLEY, You said best out of five.
HURLEY," Uh, you OK?"
HURLEY, What happened?
HURLEY, I dunno.
HURLEY, Dude... Nikki's dead.
HURLEY," We dunno. She's got no gunshot wound, no knife wound, no polar bear bite, nothing."
HURLEY," Actually, I think she said ""power lines."""
HURLEY,"  ""Paulo lies!"" That's what she said! ""Paulo lies,"" not ""power lines."" ""Paulo lies."""
HURLEY," Paulo's her... husband, or... boyfriend, or... whatever. They lived down the beach."
HURLEY, What do you know about tracking? 
HURLEY, Wow. 
HURLEY," He's just like Nikki, no wound, nothing. "
HURLEY, Yeah I know. 
HURLEY, Why are his pants undone? And why's his shoe in that tree? 
HURLEY, You see something? Sawyer? 
HURLEY," Dude, what are you doing? "
HURLEY, That's evidence. You're messing up the crime scene. 
HURLEY, I'm with Jin. It's the Monster. 
HURLEY," It does. Locke said when Eko died, his last words were ""You're next."" And Nikki and Paulo were with them. He was talking about them. "
HURLEY," Yeah, that's not really better. "
HURLEY," Dude, show some respect. You know their names, its Nikki and Paulo. "
HURLEY," Hey, man, be careful. "
HURLEY," Dude, Monster.  Creepy, they collected bugs. "
HURLEY, They must have been friends. 
HURLEY, Did you just say Exposé? 
HURLEY," Only the most awesome hour of television ever. It's like ""Baywatch"", only better. Its about Autumn and Crystal, two strippers that solve crimes with the help of their suave smooth-talking club owner, Mr. LaShade. "
HURLEY," Check it out, look at the cast list, Nikki Fernandez. That's gotta be why she was in Australia. This must have been her big break. "
HURLEY, No way. Mr. LaShade was the Cobra? 
HURLEY, Dude the Cobra's this big bad guy. His identity's been shrouded in mystery for four seasons. 
HURLEY, They had a walkie talkie? 
HURLEY," OK, so they had a walkie talkie. You think they were working with the Others, like how? "
HURLEY," I dunno, dude. I was with the Others, like, two weeks ago, they're on a total other side of the Island. "
HURLEY, Where'd you get the gun? 
HURLEY, And when were you gonna let us know? 
HURLEY, What exactly is a perimeter sweep? 
HURLEY, Hey! Desmond! You hear about what happened to Nikki and Paulo? 
HURLEY," So, do you know anything? "
HURLEY," Can you, you know, use your psychic powers? "
HURLEY," No offense dude, but as far as superpowers go, yours is kinda lame. Thanks anyway. "
HURLEY, My mate? 
HURLEY, He said he didn't know her. 
HURLEY, Yelling? 
HURLEY," At Sawyer, this morning? "
HURLEY, Vincent! Dude! 
HURLEY," Look at the facts, and ask yourself. Why is Sawyer so gung-ho about investigating this? What's in it for him? He pretended he didn't know their names, but then he was fighting with Nikki. "
HURLEY," OK, you know what, I'll go get Desmond. He'll tell you exactly what he saw. "
HURLEY, Give me the gun. 
HURLEY, Give it to me. 
HURLEY, Then how are you sweeping the perimeter? Quit lying dude. Desmond saw you fighting with Nikki this morning. 
HURLEY, Did you kill them? 
HURLEY, Why didn't you tell us this before? 
HURLEY, What? 
HURLEY," Nikki and Paulo. I guess we didn't really know you very well. And it appears, you killed each other for diamonds. But I know there are good parts to you too. You were always nice to me. And you're a member of the camp. And... I really loved Exposé. OK then, goodbye—"
HURLEY," Er, you OK? "
HURLEY," Hey, hey, what happened? "
HURLEY, Don't look at me and pretend we're not talking. I'm not supposed to be here.
HURLEY," Dude, you need to know that... there's been some chatter. After Paulo and Nikki and everything. Well, tomorrow there's gonna to be a vote."
HURLEY, To decide whether or not to banish you.
HURLEY," Well, there's debate about that, but the consensus was half a mile down the beach. "
HURLEY," I'm only saying this because there may be a way to fix it. To, like, make amends."
HURLEY," Might wanna ask yourself, about all the good stuff that comes from being a part of this... society. I mean you can't even feed yourself. You use our latrine, drink the water that Steve brings every morning to the trough—"
HURLEY, What?
HURLEY, Yeah?
HURLEY," You're making a big mistake, dude."
HURLEY, Do what?
HURLEY," Dude you stink. What is that, fish?"
HURLEY," Did you try to gut one yourself? How have you not learned that by now? I mean we've been here like, three months."
HURLEY, Do what?
HURLEY, Apologize for calling me all those names.
HURLEY, Really?
HURLEY," Claire's, like, really influential. If she votes for you to stay, you're home free dude. "
HURLEY," Nah, but you never did anything good for her either. And have you ever even asked how Aaron is?"
HURLEY," You see, that's what I'm talking about. You're sarcastic, people don't like that."
HURLEY," Moms love it when you show an interest in their babies. You should go over there, say something nice. Call her Claire. And give her this  I know you can do it, dude. "
HURLEY," But, wasn't it nice, being nice."
HURLEY," Wasn't a con, dude. If you're gonna be our temporary leader, you need to do some damage control."
HURLEY," Jack's gone. Locke's gone. Kate and Sayid. You're all we got. And Paulo and Nikki dying, we all looked to you. Then again, you totally tried to steal the diamonds, but we wanted to look to you. Look around, you made everyone happy. Just for today, they can eat boar, laugh and forget that they're totally screwed. And you did that for 'em, dude. You."
HURLEY," Yeah well, I don't think Jack wanted it either. Sucks for you, dude."
HURLEY," It's oatmeal dude, it's supposed to be soggy. "
HURLEY, Hey.
HURLEY," So. You're, like, one of them, huh?"
HURLEY, I don't remember you from the dock. Where you put bags on our heads. After you shocked us. 
HURLEY, So I hear you're a doctor. 
HURLEY, Uh-huh. 
HURLEY," The last one of you guys that came over here. Ethan. He kidnapped Claire, and... Charlie got upset. We buried him over there. "
HURLEY, What?
HURLEY," The census, I interviewed everyone. One of them isn't in the manifest — he wasn't on the plane. "
HURLEY," Dude, if we're going by a pure footrace, Supes would get dusted by The Flash."
HURLEY," Er, for charity. And Flash would totally win 'cause he can, like, vibrate through walls and stuff."
HURLEY," Well, no smashing allowed."
HURLEY, Charlie!
HURLEY," Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god."
HURLEY," Hey, here it is."
HURLEY, D'you eat those mushrooms Jack warned us about?
HURLEY," This is future crap, isn't it?"
HURLEY, Why?
HURLEY," Nah, uh uh, just, keeping Desmond here company. 'Cause, we're friends."
HURLEY," Suspicious of what? Oh, this is like when you knew Claire was drowning, isn't it? That's why you got the first-aid kit, someone's gonna get hurt. Is it me?"
HURLEY," Look, dude. You want me to take you to the wire, I want an explanation."
HURLEY, What'd you see?
HURLEY, So what are the other pieces?
HURLEY, So what? Isn't that the point? Preventing something bad?
HURLEY," So you're not trying to stop something from happening, you actually want it to happen."
HURLEY," Dude, you're gonna have to tell me again. What do we need Jin for?"
HURLEY," On the beach, when I find the cable."
HURLEY,  Here it is!
HURLEY, In one of your puzzle flashes.
HURLEY," So, if he doesn't come, then neither does the someone you won't tell me anything about."
HURLEY, Watch the master.
HURLEY," Yeah, you know, like sleeping under the stars, fire on the beach. Marshmallows. "
HURLEY,  Everybody likes marshmallows.
HURLEY, Where are you going?
HURLEY, This is it.
HURLEY, 'Cause that's exactly where I followed the wire into the jungle.
HURLEY," Way to go, dude!"
HURLEY, Here it is!
HURLEY," Just one thing, last time I followed this wire into the jungle, I almost got kebabed by one of Rousseau's spiky death-trap things. "
HURLEY," Dude, I love the part about the bird. It was a bird right?"
HURLEY," Me? OK, erm, have you heard the one about the Chupacabra.."
HURLEY," Yeah, like a bear with spines... but Mexican..."
HURLEY, What's that?
HURLEY," Uh, is that how a helicopter's supposed to sound?"
HURLEY, We gotta go out there.
HURLEY," Well, yeah."
HURLEY," Well, we gotta do something."
HURLEY," Nah, dude, it's not a food drop, you saw the beacon thing, someone like ejected."
HURLEY," Well, maybe they jumped. All that matters is that they're here."
HURLEY,  'Cause he said someone was coming.
HURLEY," Dude, seriously, I'm gonna have a coronary. "
HURLEY," What are you doing? Ow. Ah, ahh!!!"
HURLEY, Did that come down with the flashing red light thingy?
HURLEY,"  No, dude. That's a satellite phone. "
HURLEY," Crap, it's dead."
HURLEY, Is that you? And who is she?
HURLEY," Thanks for the heads up about bringing an umbrella, dude."
HURLEY," She's a chick Desmond used to date. And now he thinks she fell from the sky. So we're gonna go save her life, and she's gonna get us rescued... Dude, even if I spoke Korean, it wouldn't make any sense."
HURLEY," I'm moving as fast as I can. In case you haven't noticed dude, I'm not exactly the Flash."
HURLEY, You got something against the fastest man alive?
HURLEY," Dude, if we're going by a pure footrace, Supes would get dusted by the Flash."
HURLEY," Uh, for charity. And Flash would totally win 'cause he can, like, vibrate through walls and stuff."
HURLEY," Well, no smashing allowed."
HURLEY, Dude.
HURLEY," How about we split up? Me and Charlie go that way, you and Jin go round, and we'll meet up at that ridge over there."
HURLEY," Hey! Hey, can you hear me?!"
HURLEY," Dude, she's not moving."
HURLEY, She's alive!
HURLEY," She seems to know you, dude, she just said your name."
HURLEY, She's trying to talk. We should get her some water.
HURLEY," It's Spanish, dude."
HURLEY, She says she's dying.
HURLEY," What if this is a rescue? What if she came for us? Wha... I mean, is she gonna be OK? We can't let her..."
HURLEY, Oops.
HURLEY, What's she saying?
HURLEY," Hey, guys, chill."
HURLEY, I thought Locke killed that guy with the electro-fence thingy. 
HURLEY," Just a book, fancy radio phone thingy."
HURLEY, Like I'd tell you.
HURLEY,  Mom?
HURLEY," Take it easy, you just had a giant branch..."
HURLEY, I dunno. You're on an Island. Are you here to rescue us? Are there more of you? Can you make your phone work? 
HURLEY, Hugo Reyes. I crashed here on Oceanic Flight 815. A bunch of us survived. Is that why you're here? Were you looking for us?
HURLEY, Yeah!
HURLEY," Yeah, I know. It wasn't easy, but we found food, and a hatch..."
HURLEY, What?!
HURLEY, What the hell are you doing?
HURLEY," Yeah well, so were we."
HURLEY," Yeah, I mean shouldn't he check out her wound?"
HURLEY, Hey dude.
HURLEY, Can you keep a secret?
HURLEY, So is that like a radio?
HURLEY," You can still make it work, right?"
HURLEY, And what about the other part? The part about they found the plane and we were all dead. 
HURLEY," Uh, the luggage."
HURLEY," Dude, you know what I'm saying?  It can't be worse than haggis."
HURLEY, I dunno. Stuff. Probably secret stuff.
HURLEY, We kept the parachute lady secret.
HURLEY," Hey!!! Look, there!!! Look!!"
HURLEY, So what are we going to do?
HURLEY, Whoa!
HURLEY," Dudes, wait! I heard. I heard what you're doing. I wanna come with. Everyone — they're all going to the radio tower ... and I'm sick of trekking and, you know, explosions. I think I can help you guys out. I'm a really good paddler."
HURLEY, Why not?
HURLEY," That's uncool, man."
HURLEY," Dude, it's fine. I don't even wanna go on your stupid boat."
HURLEY," Yeah, whatever, love you too."
HURLEY," Ready, Claire? Need a hand with the little guy?"
HURLEY, Charlie's gonna be fine.
HURLEY," Hey! Hey guys, wait up!"
HURLEY, I'm coming with you guys.
HURLEY," Come on, I can help. They're my friends, too, man. Look, Charlie wouldn't let me go with him, Jack's too busy leading to even talk to me. I just wanna help, please?"
HURLEY, Woo!
HURLEY," Dude, it was over, he surrendered."
HURLEY," Attention, Others. Come in, Others. If you're listening in, I want you to know that we got you bastards. And, unless the rest of you wanna be blown up, you best stay away from our beach..."
HURLEY, Jack?
HURLEY, Dude. I'm back at the beach.
HURLEY," Yeah, I went back to help Juliet and Sawyer. I, I saved them."
HURLEY," Everyone's fine. Me, Sawyer, Juliet, Sayid, Jin, Bernard. We're all—"
HURLEY," Yeah, dude, I told you, I saved 'em all."
HURLEY," Yeah, I got ya, we'll stay put until you, like, phone home."
HURLEY," Not yet, but they're probably paddling home as we speak. Don't worry, I'm sure he's fine."
HURLEY," Stop! Don't you know who I am? Stop, wait, don't you know who I am? I'm one of the Oceanic six! I'm one of the Oceanic six!!!"
HURLEY, I wasn't running away from anyone. 
HURLEY, I'm not a celebrity.
HURLEY, Sure.
HURLEY, Really?
HURLEY," Sorry, never met her."
HURLEY, No thanks.
HURLEY, Help! Help! Help! Help! Help me! Help!
HURLEY, You can?  Oh thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
HURLEY," Jack? You there dude? Beach to Jack, come in Jack. Beach to Jack—"
HURLEY, Hey. Did you guys make it to that radio tower thingy yet?
HURLEY, Seriously? It worked?
HURLEY, Hahaha! Dude that's great! Woohoo!
HURLEY, Did I ever tell you I won the lottery? I had like a hundred and fifty million dollars. Worst thing that ever happened to me. 
HURLEY, Now it'll all be gone. Cause they all think I'm dead. We get rescued and I go back. I'm gonna be free. (Pauses) I wanna do a cannonball. I've been walking up and down this beach everyday and looking out at this water. And I wanna do a cannonball. 
HURLEY, Hey where's Charlie?
HURLEY," Desmond, where's Charlie?"
HURLEY,  Where's Charlie?!
HURLEY, We better get going.
HURLEY," You don't wait with warnings dude, you warn."
HURLEY, You almost got me that time. How about best out of seven?
HURLEY, OK. 
HURLEY, What kind of upgrade?
HURLEY, I don't wanna see the ocean. 
HURLEY," Actually, thanks, I'm... I'm fine right here. "
HURLEY, What do you mean?
HURLEY, Who'd you say you were again? I'd like to see a business card.
HURLEY," Then we're done, dude."
HURLEY,  What?
HURLEY," Nurse. Nurse! Get out of here! You better get out of here! Help me. Help me, he's after me. No no no. That guy's after me. Help me."
HURLEY," Yeah, dude, I'm fine."
HURLEY, Talk about what?
HURLEY, We'll probably get to Jack faster if we don't talk. 
HURLEY, I can keep up.
HURLEY, Guys. Guys! Guys! Guys!!! Guys!
HURLEY, Uh oh.
HURLEY, Hello?
HURLEY, Help! Help! Help!!!
HURLEY, There's nothing here. There's nothing here. There's nothing here. There's nothing here.
HURLEY," I just... fell behind, I guess."
HURLEY, I got scared.
HURLEY, Jack should never have called those people.
HURLEY," It's gonna be hard, to talk them into thinking they're not coming here to rescue us."
HURLEY," Sorry, I was just er... I got lost."
HURLEY, I'll tell her.
HURLEY, He's dead. Charlie's dead.
HURLEY," What you talking about, dude?"
HURLEY, What guy?
HURLEY," No need to freak out? I'm trying to buy some jerky and a slushy, and suddenly you're standing over there by the Ho Hos. You're dead, what do you expect me to do?"
HURLEY," I may be in a mental hospital, but I know you're dead, and I'm not having an imaginary conversation with you. "
HURLEY," OK, prove it."
HURLEY," Alright, OK."
HURLEY, Did you know you were going to die when you swam out there?
HURLEY,  Then why didn't you tell me?
HURLEY," I'm not listening to this. No, 'cause you're not here."
HURLEY," I'm gonna close my eyes and count to five, and when I open them, you'll be gone."
HURLEY, One!
HURLEY, Two!
HURLEY, Three!
HURLEY, Four!
HURLEY, Five!
HURLEY, He was trying to help us.
HURLEY," He's not crazy. What about Charlie? Charlie went down to that place so we could all be rescued. And whatever he did down there, it worked. But then something must have happened. He must have heard something before he...  I don't know why, but he changed his mind."
HURLEY, Because the last thing he did was to warn us that the people on that boat are not who they said they were. So I'm not listening to you. I'm listening to my friend. I'm listening to Charlie.
HURLEY, Jack.
HURLEY," You're on. So, consult, huh? Does that mean you're back doing surgical stuff?"
HURLEY, Reporters leaving you alone?
HURLEY," You'd look weird with a beard, dude. That's H-O. So, what are you really doing here, Jack?"
HURLEY," Checking to see if I was nuts, if I was gonna tell."
HURLEY, You're up.
HURLEY, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I went with Locke. I should have stayed with you.
HURLEY," I don't think we did the right thing, Jack. I think it wants us to come back."
HURLEY, And it's going to do everything it can—
HURLEY," Never say never, dude."
HURLEY, Dude. What's wrong with you? You're gonna get struck by lightning.
HURLEY," It's a friggin' monsoon, we gotta..."
HURLEY, I thought the cabin was back that way.
HURLEY," I, er, thought you were talking about the airplane cabin."
HURLEY, Why do you wanna know?
HURLEY," Forty-eight of us survived the crash, that's not counting the tail-section. They're pretty much all dead now..."
HURLEY, Maybe we should go see who launched that flare.
HURLEY,  Maybe we got turned around. It could be anywhere.
HURLEY," If all they want is her, maybe we should just let her go? I mean, I thought we were just gonna go hide. Why do we need to take prisoners? "
HURLEY,  How's she going to be valuable?
HURLEY," Nuh uh, no, that's not what I signed up for."
HURLEY," Look, I'm just saying that if we let her go, they'll look at is as a sign of good faith."
HURLEY, I'm just trying to come up with some kind of compromise—
HURLEY,  They left me.
HURLEY," Locke's gone off the reservation, man. I mean, he took this one chick hostage, he said Walt was the one who told him to kill the other chick, and, and he—"
HURLEY," Dude, don't ask. I was, like, just trying to argue with him, so he would just like, you know, chill, but—"
HURLEY, Who are you?
HURLEY," Oh, awesome. The ship sent us another Sawyer."
HURLEY," Look, I guess they were too busy tying me up to tell me. I don't know."
HURLEY," Yeah, they were freaked. Locke said the people on the ship were here to rescue Charlotte and then kill us.  So... are you?"
HURLEY," Um, Locke said they were gonna go by Ben's house before they took off."
HURLEY,"  For all I know, they could have locked Ben up in a closet too."
HURLEY," Sorry, dude."
HURLEY, He's talking to that angry Chinese guy.
HURLEY, Yeah... I saw you snap that guy's neck with that break dancing thing you do with your legs. I think I'll hang back here.
HURLEY, Yeah. 
HURLEY, Cool. That dude creeps me out.
HURLEY," No, we moved him to the boathouse that... You just totally Scooby-Dood me, didn't you."
HURLEY," You're not going to let him go, are you?"
HURLEY, Just don't tell Locke it was me.
HURLEY, So... what do you wanna watch? Xanadu or Satan's Doom? 
HURLEY, Sorry. 
HURLEY, Hey Kate. 
HURLEY, I don't know. Guess I'm just ... lucky.
HURLEY, Are you kidding? Is anyone else coming?
HURLEY, Good. So... where is she?
HURLEY, She's awesome.
HURLEY," I don't know, I... kinda have two left hands."
HURLEY, Wow... she looks just like Jin.
HURLEY," So... I guess we should, like, go see him."
HURLEY," Um, we kind of, like, knew that forever ago."
HURLEY, Yeah. He won't even tell us who his spy on the boat is.
HURLEY, What?
HURLEY, We're all gonna die.
HURLEY," This is exactly what he wants—to fight amongst ourselves. You're making a big mistake, dude."
HURLEY, Can't believe you're just giving him Australia. Australia's the key to the whole game.
HURLEY, Who is it?
HURLEY, What's going on?
HURLEY, How's Sawyer gonna get back in?
HURLEY, Was that Claire's house?! Claire was there!
HURLEY, You mean towards the guys with guns?
HURLEY, Did you just call that thing?!
HURLEY, Wait. Leave me out of this.
HURLEY, Stop! Put the guns down. I'll go with Locke.
HURLEY," It's okay, Sawyer.  Please, put your gun down."
HURLEY,  You too.
HURLEY, You guys go back to the beach. I'll catch up sooner or later.
HURLEY,  Hey Jack.
HURLEY," 'Cause we're dead... all of us. All the Oceanic Six, we're all dead. We never got off that island."
HURLEY, What'd you do today?
HURLEY, I thought you didn't want anything to do with Aaron.
HURLEY, Living with Kate... taking care of Aaron... it all seems so perfect... just like heaven.
HURLEY," I was happy too, Jack... for a while, anyway. Then I saw Charlie.  He likes to sit with me on the bench out on the front lawn. It's pretty cool, actually."
HURLEY," Well, yesterday, he told me you were gonna be coming by. He wanted me to give you a message."
HURLEY," He made me write it down so I wouldn't mess it up.  ""You're not supposed to raise him, Jack.""  Does that make any sense?"
HURLEY, Do you think he means Aaron?
HURLEY," Hey, Jack? Charlie said someone's gonna be visiting you too. Soon."
HURLEY, Who builds a cabin in the middle of the jungle anyway?
HURLEY, So? How about answering it?
HURLEY, And why are we even going there?
HURLEY, We've been walking all day. Are we gonna get there soon?
HURLEY, I'm not even in front.  
HURLEY," Oh, this is just awesome."
HURLEY, What? Here in the dark with the monster and... him?
HURLEY," Dude, what's gonna happen when those freighter guys come back?"
HURLEY,  Mallomars.
HURLEY, Hmm? Huh? What?
HURLEY," I thought we didn't know where we're going, dude."
HURLEY, Hmm.
HURLEY, Can I ask you somethin'?
HURLEY," Why am I here, man?"
HURLEY," Well, I have a theory as to why we're the only ones who can see it."
HURLEY," I think we can see it 'cause we're the craziest. So how'd you figure out where it was, dude?"
HURLEY, Pit stop? Where?
HURLEY, Whoa. What happened to 'em?
HURLEY, What's he doing down there?  
HURLEY," So... This is where you shot Locke and left him for dead, huh?"
HURLEY," Is that why you killed all these people, too?"
HURLEY," Well, if the Others didn't wipe out the DHARMA Initiative—"
HURLEY, Then whose was it?
HURLEY, But I thought you were their leader.
HURLEY, Did you find what you were looking for?
HURLEY," Here you go. Drink up, dude. Digging through dead bodies takes it out of you."
HURLEY," Uh, what?"
HURLEY," Oh, I get it. Now you got your magic map, you don't—you don't need me anymore."
HURLEY, And you think walking through the jungle at night by myself is gonna be any safer?
HURLEY, I think I'll stick with you guys. This way?
HURLEY, Guys? Cabin.
HURLEY," Yeah, I'm cool with you going in alone too."
HURLEY," Was that directed at me, Dude?"
HURLEY," I don't want it back, any of it. That money was bad luck."
HURLEY, So when is someone gonna tell me where we're going?
HURLEY, And what's that?
HURLEY, And why are we going to a greenhouse exactly?
HURLEY, Right. And how are we gonna do that?
HURLEY," Well, if you could move the island whenever you wanted, why didn't you just move it before the psychos with guns got here?"
HURLEY, Awesome.
HURLEY," What are you doing, Dude?"
HURLEY, Mom? Dad?
HURLEY, Mr. Tranh? Lady Tranh?
HURLEY, Hello?
HURLEY, Why am I doing this? Why am I doing this? Why am I doing this?
HURLEY, I don't know. I thought there might be a prowler or something.
HURLEY, No way.
HURLEY," Hey, Kate."
HURLEY," Hey, little buddy."
HURLEY," Wow, you guys are here."
HURLEY," Yeah, my mom... really doesn't get it, Dude."
HURLEY, I told you I don't want anything.
HURLEY, Not with the money. I don't want anything from the money.
HURLEY, You fixed it.
HURLEY, Is this some kind of joke?
HURLEY," 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. Did you do this?"
HURLEY, Those are the numbers! Right there! The numbers I won the lottery with!
HURLEY," No. No, not a coincidence. I don't want this. I don't want any of it!"
HURLEY," Okay, let's say this greenhouse place does what you say, and, yeah, I get it. It's really dangerous and unpredictable. But suppose somehow it works, and we move the island. Doesn't that mean the dudes with guns move, too?"
HURLEY," Well, isn't that, you know, a problem?"
HURLEY," Well, what about me? I still wanna get off it!"
HURLEY, Whoa. Wait. What?
HURLEY, Sawyer!
HURLEY," Dude, you came back. How'd you know where I was?"
HURLEY,"  Yeah. Yeah, man. You, too."
HURLEY," Uh, dude, probably not the best idea right now. Those Rambo guys are taking Ben to that helicopter. He surrendered himself to 'em about an hour ago."
HURLEY, Yeah.
HURLEY, I'm sorry. Do I know you?
HURLEY, I won't do anything crazy.
HURLEY," Hey, Walt."
HURLEY," You're getting big, Dude."
HURLEY, I'm sorry.
HURLEY,  We're lying... because it's the only way to protect everyone that didn't come back.
HURLEY," Like your dad, yeah."
HURLEY, I don't know. Leader stuff?
HURLEY, Came from a box Ben dug up out of the ground. They're good.
HURLEY, Thanks for coming back for me.
HURLEY, Claire and the baby okay?
HURLEY," Sayid! Kate!  Good to see you, Dude."
HURLEY," After we drop everyone off at the boat, we can come back and look for Claire, right?"
HURLEY, Sayid?
HURLEY," I think visiting hours are over, Dude."
HURLEY, Come with you where?
HURLEY," And why would I go anywhere with you? I haven't seen you in, like, forever."
HURLEY, What circumstances?
HURLEY, What?
HURLEY, What happened?
HURLEY," What do you mean, they ""said"" it was suicide? And why are you calling him ""Bentham""? His name is—"
HURLEY," Dude, I've been having regular conversations with dead people. The last thing I need now is paranoia."
HURLEY," We're not going back, are we?"
HURLEY, Okay then. Hold on a sec. 
HURLEY," Checkmate, Mr. Eko."
HURLEY, Hey! There it is! The boat! I see it! Behind us!
HURLEY, It's gone.
HURLEY, Jack!
HURLEY, I got him.
HURLEY," Is he breathing? Oh, my God. Is he breathing?"
HURLEY, Yeah.
HURLEY," You're all right, man. You're okay."
HURLEY, Desmond.
HURLEY, Is he okay?
HURLEY, I can't believe he did it.
HURLEY, Locke. He moved the island.
HURLEY," Oh, really? 'Cause... one minute it was there, and the next it was gone, so... unless we, like, overlooked it, dude, that's exactly what he did. But... if you've got another explanation, man, I'd love to hear it."
HURLEY, Hi.
HURLEY, What's this place called?
HURLEY," Membata. Why are we doing this, Dude? Sailing 3,000 miles to another island?"
HURLEY,"  Here she comes, right now."
HURLEY,  Awesome.
HURLEY, You want a fry?
HURLEY," You know, maybe if you ate more comfort food you wouldn't have to go around shooting people."
HURLEY, So that dude you popped outside Santa Rosa—who was he?
HURLEY, Do you think he was gonna kill me?
HURLEY, You mean Locke.
HURLEY, I need a cool code name.
HURLEY, So when'd you become so paranoid?
HURLEY," Oh, yeah? Paranoid like what? What kind of things?"
HURLEY, Wait. He's on our side now?
HURLEY, Sayid! Whoa. You okay?
HURLEY," Dude. Dude. Oh, man. I thought it was supposed to be a safe house. I never should've left the Island."
HURLEY," Dude, they'll find out."
HURLEY," I don't think we should lie, dude."
HURLEY, How does lying protect them?
HURLEY,"  Look, he's your dad, right? Can't you just, like... call him off?"
HURLEY," But he'll never find them. I mean, the Island disappeared. We all saw it. It's gone. Bloop!"
HURLEY," Not if someone backs me up. Sayid, come on. They'll think I'm nuts if I tell the truth. But what if we all do? And if we can stick together, we can make 'em believe us. I don't want to spend the rest of my life lying. Do you?"
HURLEY," You know what, dude? I'm gonna remember this. And someday, you're gonna need my help, and I'm telling you right now... you're not gettin' it."
HURLEY," Wake up, Sayid! Sayid! Sayid, wake up! Sayid!"
HURLEY," No, no, no, no, no! What do I do?!"
HURLEY, What am I supposed to do?!
HURLEY," Okay, okay, okay. Just stay calm."
HURLEY, Ana Lucia?
HURLEY, I just... I—I thought—
HURLEY,"  Actually, it's ketchup. We went to a—a drive-thru, and, uh..."
HURLEY, I do?
HURLEY,  Yeah.
HURLEY," Thanks, Ana Lucia."
HURLEY, Well... you heard her.
HURLEY," Dude, wake up! Come on. I can't do this on my own!"
HURLEY, I promise I'll pay you back.
HURLEY, Wait right here.
HURLEY, I like Shih Tzus.
HURLEY, Yeah.
HURLEY, Yeah.
HURLEY, No.
HURLEY, I just have one of those faces.
HURLEY, I don't believe in lying.
HURLEY, No. I must look like him.
HURLEY, Sorry. Wrong dude. Keep the change.
HURLEY," Okay. Okay, we're outta here."
HURLEY," Hey, Dad. How's it going?"
HURLEY, You seen the news?
HURLEY," Uh, yeah. Kinda. Is Mom here?"
HURLEY, Is he... breathing?
HURLEY, He got shot by a dart.
HURLEY," No, we were at the safe house."
HURLEY," Sayid took me there to protect me. Then these two guys jumped down, they shot him with darts, and now he's—he's in a coma or something."
HURLEY, Sayid pulled me out. I'm in danger. We both are.
HURLEY,  I'm not sure exactly.
HURLEY," Dad, please! Just don't tell 'em I'm here!"
HURLEY, No. Sayid did.
HURLEY, He saved me.
HURLEY," No, no, no. We can't go public. They're after us."
HURLEY, I don't know. Sayid knows. He can explain.
HURLEY," Did you not hear me? People are trying to kill us. We go to a hospital, they'll find us! Like—like The Godfather. It's the last place you go. Everyone knows it. Wh—they—they smother you with pillows and make it look like an accident. Sayid, please wake up!"
HURLEY, I think I know what to do.
HURLEY," Dude, they're on a stakeout?"
HURLEY, Do you think I am?
HURLEY," I'm not crazy, and I have a really good reason why I'm lying to you."
HURLEY," He's not dead, Ma."
HURLEY, He's not?!
HURLEY," He is breathing... kind of. Dad, we gotta go now."
HURLEY," Mom, please!"
HURLEY," Yeah, Mom. I know. Look, everything's gonna make sense. I promise."
HURLEY, He is my friend... but he's also got this double life where he does crazy Ninja moves and spy stuff. But he's a good guy.
HURLEY, Mom—
HURLEY, I don't know.
HURLEY," We lied, Ma!"
HURLEY,"  All of us—the Oceanic Six, we lied about what happened after the crash."
HURLEY," Okay. See, we did crash, but it was on this crazy island. And we waited for rescue, and there wasn't any rescue. And there was a smoke monster, and then there were other people on the island. We called them the Others, and they started attacking us. And we found some hatches, and there was a button you had to push every 108 minutes or... well, I was never really clear on that. But... the Others didn't have anything to do with the hatches. That was the DHARMA Initiative. The Others killed them, and now they're trying to kill us. And then we teamed up with the Others because some worse people were coming on a freighter. Desmond's girlfriend's father sent them to kill us. So we stole their helicopter and we flew it to their freighter, but it blew up. And we couldn't go back to the island because it disappeared, so then we crashed into the ocean, and we floated there for a while until a boat came and picked us up. And by then, there were six of us. That part was true.  But the re..."
HURLEY, But the rest of the people... who were on the plane? They're still on that island.
HURLEY," A lot of people died, ma. And now this bad stuff is happening because... well, um...  we shouldn't have lied. "
HURLEY, Aah!  Aah.
HURLEY, Aah!
HURLEY, Get away from me. Get away!
HURLEY," No way, dude. Sayid warned me about you."
HURLEY, No. You're—you're playing one of your mind games. They would never trust you.
HURLEY, And what's that?
HURLEY," Never, dude."
HURLEY," Hey! Hey, you got me! That's right, you got me! That's right! I'm the killer!"
HURLEY," I'm the killer. I'm crazy. I'm a murderer. I killed four people... three people. However many are dead, I killed them. I killed them."
HURLEY, I killed them all. J—just—just get me away from here.
HURLEY, Just get me out of here.
HURLEY, Jack? It's me.
HURLEY," Hey, did Sayid get to you? Did my dad drop him off?"
HURLEY, Is he okay?
HURLEY, Awesome.
HURLEY," Dude, I'm totally cool. I'm in L.A. County lockup. Oh, and tell Sayid I did exactly what he said. I'm totally safe. Ben's never gonna get me now. Thanks, dude."
HURLEY,  Help! Anyone!
HURLEY," Help, Jack!"
HURLEY, Help! Anyone!
HURLEY, Help!
HURLEY, Help!
HURLEY, Help!
HURLEY, Help!
HURLEY," Aah! Oh, God! Oh, God!"
HURLEY," Oh, my God!"
HURLEY, What?
HURLEY," Oh. Oh, my God. It really happened."
HURLEY," What do you mean ""standby""? There's no standbys."
HURLEY," No. I bought those seats, all 78 of 'em. I'm Hugo Reyes. They're not open. They're mine. Check and see."
HURLEY," You know, it doesn't matter why. They can take the next plane."
HURLEY," All that matters is that I'm here, right?"
HURLEY,"  Okay, then. Let's do this. After you."
HURLEY, Wait! What's he doing here?!
HURLEY," No, no! He can't come!"
HURLEY, No one told me he was gonna be here.
HURLEY," Yes, Jack. I'll be fine."
HURLEY,  Dude... you might wanna fasten your seat belt.
HURLEY," Crashing? No. One second, I'm being tossed around. The next thing I know, I'm in the lagoon."
HURLEY, Dude...
HURLEY, Jin?
HURLEY," So you didn't make it, huh?"
HURLEY," You didn't make it. It's cool. No biggie. You're not the first person to visit me, you know. But what's up with the wheelchair?"
HURLEY, Oh. Is that how you died?
HURLEY, Sure you're not.
HURLEY,"  Hey, Susie, am I talking to a dude in a wheelchair right now?"
HURLEY," Whoa, dude. What are you doing here?"
HURLEY, Wait. What?
HURLEY, You mean Jack and Kate—
HURLEY," I'm sorry, dude. I don't think that's gonna happen. Jack's a doctor now, and—and Sun's, like, got her baby, and Kate's got Aaron."
HURLEY," Dude, be cool. Don't look, but we're being watched."
HURLEY,  Dude!
HURLEY, What?!
HURLEY," That dude is far from okay. When I first got locked up in here, he showed up, claiming that he worked for Oceanic Air. He's evil! You should not be trusting that guy."
HURLEY," No, no, no! I'm not listening to you!"
HURLEY,"  La, la, la, la, la. I wanna go back in. I wanna go back in."
HURLEY," No, I'm not going anywhere with you! Go away! Bye! Get out of here!"
HURLEY, Dude... you might wanna fasten your seat belt.
HURLEY, You're alive.  Dude!  I can't believe it! 
HURLEY, Oh!  Oh!
HURLEY," ""Kong.""  I actually missed that."
HURLEY, So what's up with you guys and the old DHARMA jumpsuits?
HURLEY, Uh... what?
HURLEY,"  Dude, your English is awesome."
HURLEY, What about everyone else from the plane?  They could still be out there.
HURLEY, Sawyer's back!
HURLEY, I vote for not camping.
HURLEY," Okay, so it's 1977."
HURLEY, And... you guys are all members of the DHARMA Initiative.
HURLEY," Well, you do realize those dudes get wiped out, right?  I saw where all the bodies got dumped."
HURLEY," Well, aren't you gonna warn 'em?  Aren't you gonna stop it from happening?"
HURLEY," What if they start asking us questions we can't answer, like, uh, who's president in 1977?"
HURLEY, Nama-what?
HURLEY, I guess we found Sayid.
HURLEY, Fresh off the griddle. And don't forget to try the dipping sauces. They really
HURLEY, So...  What's going on with Sayid?
HURLEY, And you're going to?
HURLEY," Well, if Sawyer didn't tell you anything, why would Juliet?"
HURLEY, 'Cause they're together.
HURLEY," ""Together"" as... They live together. Like, not as roommates. You know, ""together"" like you guys were."
HURLEY," Well, I guess I better... Go make some more waffles."
HURLEY," What's he doing here?! No, no, he can't come!"
HURLEY, Uh...is he talking about Sayid?
HURLEY, Checking to see if I'm disappearing.
HURLEY," ""Back to the Future"", man.  We came back in time to the island and changed stuff.  So if little Ben dies, he'll never grow up to be big Ben, who's the one who made us come back here in the first place.  Which means we can't be here.  And therefore, dude?  We don't exist."
HURLEY, Am I?
HURLEY, This is really confusing.
HURLEY, Let me get this straight.
HURLEY, All this already happened.
HURLEY, So this conversation we're having right now...we already had it.
HURLEY, Then what am I gonna say next?
HURLEY, Ha!  Then your theory is wrong!
HURLEY," Okay, answer me this.  If all this already happened to me, then...why don't I remember any of it?"
HURLEY, Say that again.
HURLEY," Aha!  I can't shoot you.  Because if you die in 1977, then you'll never come back to the island on the freighter 30 years from now."
HURLEY, But you said Ben couldn't die because he still has to grow up and become the leader of the Others.
HURLEY," But when we first captured Ben, and Sayid, like, tortured him, then why wouldn't he remember getting shot by that same guy when he was a kid?"
HURLEY, Huh.  
HURLEY, Is he in trouble?
HURLEY," Nah, dude, I just signed it out."
HURLEY," Well, where you going?"
HURLEY," Me too.  I made lunch for the crew.  Sandwiches.  Want one?  Ham and cheese, and I made my secret garlic mayo."
HURLEY," Why?  We're going to the same place.  Why don't we carpool?  It'll help with global warming, which hasn't happened yet, so maybe we can prevent it.  ...Wait a sec.  Are you on some kind of secret mission?"
HURLEY," How do you spell ""bounty hunter""?"
HURLEY, It's personal.
HURLEY, Dude... did you just... you know?
HURLEY, You know.  It stinks.  Did you...
HURLEY," Well, it wasn't me."
HURLEY," Nah, man, there's something foul in here.  It's coming from back there."
HURLEY, Unh-unh.  That's not possible.
HURLEY," Okay, maybe it is possible.  Pull over.  I gotta check."
HURLEY," I gotta check.  If those sandwiches are bad, people could get sick."
HURLEY, Will you pull over?!
HURLEY," Dude, there's a body bag back here.  With a body in it."
HURLEY," Yeah, well, who is he?  What happened?"
HURLEY," Dude, what happened to him?"
HURLEY, How does a filling get blown through someone's head?
HURLEY, How do you know all this?
HURLEY," Yeah, but how do you know what he was thinking?"
HURLEY, You can talk to dead people.
HURLEY,"  Don't worry, dude.  Your secret's safe with me.  You wanna know why?"
HURLEY," 'Cause I can talk to 'em, too."
HURLEY, I don't know why you just won't admit it.  You can trust me.  I talk to lots of dead people.
HURLEY," Sure, all the time.  Sometimes we even play chess."
HURLEY, Of course.  Why wouldn't I?
HURLEY, Aha!  You wouldn't know how it works unless you can do it.
HURLEY,  That's how it works for me.
HURLEY, You're just jealous my powers are better than yours.
HURLEY, Don't worry.  I won't tell anyone about the body.
HURLEY, Dude.  I can keep a secret.
HURLEY, I like the kitchen.
HURLEY, Gross.
HURLEY," Dude, that guy's a total douche."
HURLEY,  So anyway...
HURLEY," Are you kidding me?  How weird is it that your dad is that dude from all those movies?  Only back then, he was called Marvin Candle.  Was that, like, a stage name?"
HURLEY," Well, if you didn't want to talk about it, why'd you tell me?  How long have you known he was your dad?"
HURLEY, But all those DHARMA dudes end up dead.  Don't you wanna... save him?
HURLEY, Polar bear poop.  Got it.
HURLEY," So I'm new here, Dr. Chang.  What is it exactly you do at the Orchid?"
HURLEY," Oh, really?  You can't tell anyone?  Not even your wife?"
HURLEY, What about your kids?
HURLEY, 3 months?  Wow!  Congrats.  What's his name?
HURLEY," Small world!  That's your name, too.  Right, Miles?"
HURLEY," So are you a fan of jazz, Dr. Chang?  Like Miles Davis?"
HURLEY," So you two have been here for... three years now.  Must be pretty tight, huh?"
HURLEY, Great.  We should all... get together for a beer sometime.  How awesome would that be?
HURLEY," Dude, what is this place?  And what's up with all the secrecy?"
HURLEY, 42.
HURLEY, 'Cause they're building our hatch.
HURLEY, The one that crashed our plane.
HURLEY," That hatch they're building?  There's gonna be an accident, then they're gonna have to build a computer with a button you have to push so the world doesn't end."
HURLEY," So your dad... is he around... you know, when we came from?  The future?"
HURLEY," Well, then this is kind of awesome for you, huh?"
HURLEY," Because you get to hang out with him, you know, get to know him better and stuff."
HURLEY," And don't bother thanking me, but he was totally down for that beer, dude.  You know, and maybe he'll let you hold baby you, or you can change your own diaper or--"
HURLEY, Whoa!
HURLEY, Why not?  Did he beat you up when you were little or something?
HURLEY, 'Cause you're in pain and you need to let it out.
HURLEY, But he's not gone.  We just dropped him off.
HURLEY, Give that back to me.
HURLEY, It's not a diary!  It's personal!!
HURLEY, Give that--give that back to me.
HURLEY, Give it back!
HURLEY,"  It's ""furry.""  ""Furry fist.""  I need a spell-check."
HURLEY, I'm writing Empire Strikes Back.
HURLEY," It's 1977, right?"
HURLEY," So Stars Wars just came out.  And pretty soon, George Lucas is gonna be looking for a sequel.  I've seen Empire, like, 200 times, so I figured I'd make life easier and send him the script... with a couple improvements."
HURLEY," Oh, yeah?  Well, at least I'm not scared to talk to my own dad."
HURLEY," Sorry I said you were afraid to talk to your dad, dude."
HURLEY," I used to hate my dad, too."
HURLEY," He left when I was 10.  But the best thing I ever did was give him a second chance.  We got to be the best of friends, and although I may never see him again, I miss him.  And I know he feels the same."
HURLEY," That was Luke's attitude, too."
HURLEY," In Empire, Luke found out Vader was his father, but instead of putting away his lightsaber and talking about it, he overreacted and got his hand cut off.  I mean, they worked it out eventually, but at what cost?  Another Death Star was destroyed, Boba Fett got eaten by the Sarlacc, and we got the Ewoks.  It all could've been avoided if they'd just, you know, communicated.  And let's face it.  The Ewoks sucked, dude."
HURLEY," Well, that dude in the closet--I thought he worked for you.  Can't you convince him that it was all, like, a misunderstanding?"
HURLEY," Yeah, me neither.  After all we did to get back here?  And now we're just gonna run off again?  It'd be kinda wishy-washy."
HURLEY, You guys were in 1954?  Like... Fonzie times?
HURLEY," That's not good, right?"
HURLEY, So what's the rescue plan?
HURLEY, But they got Sawyer and Juliet.
HURLEY," We gotta do something.  I mean, Sawyer would never leave us behind."
HURLEY, But we asked you first.
HURLEY," Dude, that's ridiculous."
HURLEY, Uh... 1931?
HURLEY," Yeah.  Yes, I am."
HURLEY,  There's... no such thing.
HURLEY," All right, dude, we're from the future.  Sorry."
HURLEY," Why is he yelling at her, dude?"
HURLEY," Sorry, man."
HURLEY," Don't worry.  It's gonna be okay.  Sawyer always has a plan, right?"
HURLEY, What's going on back there?  Is Sayid okay?
HURLEY," Ah, let's pull over!"
HURLEY, I don't know where we're going.
HURLEY," Why do you want to go there?  If Sayid's shot, shouldn't we--"
HURLEY, The Swan it is.
HURLEY, Uhh...we're about five minutes away!
HURLEY, That's why.
HURLEY, You don't understand.  This is a big mistake.  I killed a bunch of people.
HURLEY," Look, dude... there are men with tranquilizer guns hunting me down like an animal.  They wanna bring me somewhere against my will."
HURLEY," Oh.  Sorry.  I didn't see it was taken, dude."
HURLEY, Cool.  Are you sure?
HURLEY, You want some?  Cherry.
HURLEY, So what were you in for?
HURLEY, Jail.  I was there 'cause I killed three people.  But I didn't really.  I guess they figured it out.  What about you?
HURLEY," Well, then what were you doing sitting outside a prison?  In a cab?"
HURLEY, Oh.  Then you must be dead.
HURLEY," Well, what do you want from me?"
HURLEY, 'Cause I'm cursed.
HURLEY," Uh-huh.  That's why the plane crashed, my friends died--Libby, Charlie.  Now they visit me, and I can't make it stop."
HURLEY," How do you mean ""blessed?"""
HURLEY," Oh, I'm sure it's wonderful, except for the part where I'm crazy."
HURLEY," Who are you, dude?"
HURLEY, Wait!  You forgot your guitar.
HURLEY," Don't worry, dude.  Everything'll be fine when Jack changes the future... or the past.  One of those."
HURLEY," Dude, what happened to your face?"
HURLEY, Dude! Dude! What are you doin'?
HURLEY, I'm sorry...
HURLEY," But... you know, there's a handicapped spot right over here."
HURLEY," I'm really sorry. They were supposed to reserve a spot for me, so... you know, I just... parked here."
HURLEY," Actually, I own the company."
HURLEY, Hugo Reyes.
HURLEY," Cool. What do you do here, John?"
HURLEY, Oh? Who's your boss?
HURLEY, Randy Nations?
HURLEY, Yeah... that guy is a huge douche. Want me to talk to him for you?
HURLEY," Tell you what, John. I own a temp agency too..."
HURLEY," Call this number and tell them that Hugo said to hook you up with a new job, pronto."
HURLEY, And chin up. Things are gonna work out.
HURLEY," Tie again, Dude."
HURLEY, Hungry?
HURLEY, I could eat.
HURLEY," Hey man, you know if there's like a kitchen in this place?"
HURLEY," Dude, what are you doing here ?"
HURLEY, For what?
HURLEY, What kind of things?
HURLEY, Nothing. I'm just you know...looking...because I'm a fan of ...temples and like history...Indiana Jones stuff. 
HURLEY, I'm a candidate and I can do what I want.
HURLEY, Doesn't matter. Why don't you go back to the courtyard ?
HURLEY, What'd he say?
HURLEY, Going through the secret passageway like you told me. 
HURLEY, You ever tried to get Jack to do something? It's like impossible. I can just go myself. 
HURLEY," OK it's bad enough you already made me write down way too much stuff, and I just lied to a Samurai. Look, if you've any idea of how to get Jack to go on your little adventure, I'm listening dude."
HURLEY, Be cool man. Act natural.
HURLEY," Dude, keep your voice down. I'm gonna get up and go. Wait ten seconds and then follow me. "
HURLEY, I found a secret tunnel that leads out to the jungle.
HURLEY," Well, Jacob told me about it. Said you and me have to go."
HURLEY," I told him you'd say that, so he told me to tell you ""You have what it takes."""
HURLEY," He said you have what it takes, he said you'd know what that meant. "
HURLEY, What?
HURLEY," He's kind of dead. Turns up whenever he wants, like Obi-Wan Kenobi. But...if you wanna talk to him, he's where we're going, dude."
HURLEY,  It's this way. 
HURLEY," Hey, Kate. There's a secret door to get back into the Temple on the north wall by the big tree..."
HURLEY,  Dude!  Jacob said just you and me...she's kinda not invited. 
HURLEY," Sorry, dude. "
HURLEY," You know, what happened back there. Wrecking your game with Kate. "
HURLEY, Yeah? What happened to you guys? I thought you were gonna get married and have like a dozen kids. 
HURLEY, Really? I think you'd make a great dad. 
HURLEY, What is that? 
HURLEY," Dude, it's Shannon's. "
HURLEY,  The caves we used to live in? 
HURLEY," I totally forgot these were in here, man. "
HURLEY," Wait a sec. What if we time-travelled again? To, like, dinosaur times? And then we died and then we got buried here?  What if these skeletons are us? "
HURLEY, What's that? 
HURLEY," You were looking for water, right? "
HURLEY, Why'd you do that? 
HURLEY," This is cool, dude. Very old school."
HURLEY," You know, you and me trekking through the jungle, on our way to do something that we don't quite understand. Good times. You mind if I ask you something?"
HURLEY," Why'd you come back, you know, to the island?"
HURLEY," Back in L.A., Jacob hopped into the back of my cab, and told me I was supposed to, so I came."
HURLEY," What? If you have a good reason for coming back, let's hear it man. "
HURLEY," Dude, I'm sorry."
HURLEY, It's not far. It's not far at all.
HURLEY, It's right there. It's a lighthouse.
HURLEY, Guess we weren't lookin for it.
HURLEY," Pretty cool, huh?"
HURLEY, I guess so. First we gotta go upstairs and turn this thing on. 
HURLEY, No.
HURLEY, Whoa! Dude this is cool. Must've built this to help ships get here and stuff. I guess they used the mirror because electricity hadn't been invented yet.
HURLEY, Ahh he's not here yet. Lets get started.  Tell me when it gets to 108 degrees. 
HURLEY, Did I see what?
HURLEY, It's just ocean dude.
HURLEY, I...I don't think Jacob wants 
HURLEY, What. What is that?
HURLEY, Oh. That's weird.
HURLEY, I don't know.
HURLEY, Well I was just...kind of...assuming.
HURLEY," It doesn't work like that, I told you. He just kind of shows up whenever he feels like it. "
HURLEY, I don't know. 
HURLEY, He didn't tell me.
HURLEY, Aren't we supposed-- 
HURLEY," I don't know, Jack!"
HURLEY," Where were you, man? "
HURLEY," Yeah, well if you'd told me that and I'd like, explained everything, then maybe Jack wouldn't have freaked out and smashed your mirror into a billion pieces. Thanks for the seven years of bad luck, by the way."
HURLEY," I have ink on my forehead? That's all you have to say? Jack broke your lighthouse, dude. Mission un-accomplished. Whoever you said we need to help get to the island is totally screwed."
HURLEY," So...everything you wanted me to do didn't get done, and you don't even care?"
HURLEY, Wait a minute. Did you want Jack to see what was in that mirror?  Why?
HURLEY," That was your plan? I think it backfired, man."
HURLEY, Well next time how about you tell me everything up front. I'm not big on secret plans OK. 
HURLEY, What? Why? 
HURLEY," Dude, we gotta warn them!"
HURLEY, Cheese curds...
HURLEY, I'm hungry. Let's eat breakfast first.
HURLEY," What's the rush? You know, maybe we should... take our time."
HURLEY, Because.
HURLEY," Uh-uh, dude. It's this way."
HURLEY," Yeah, but that was a mistake. This is faster. Trust me, it's just around here. It's a short cut."
HURLEY," Dude, do you trust that guy?"
HURLEY, So... you're not time-traveling?
HURLEY, But... you look the same as you did thirty years ago. How's that possible?
HURLEY," Is this, like, a Terminator thing? Are you a cyborg? "
HURLEY, Vampire?
HURLEY," I thought you said we were going to the Temple, dude."
HURLEY," Jacob kind of, sort of, hinted at it..."
HURLEY, Yeah.
HURLEY,  Jack? Dude where are you?
HURLEY," Do not open that, there's dynamite in there, it's mega unstable."
HURLEY, So did Doctor Arzt. And I was wiping him out of my shirt two days later.
HURLEY,  Dude it's time to go.
HURLEY," He's opening up a crate of dynamite, and he said he wanted to kill himself."
HURLEY, What?
HURLEY," Dude, seriously! Let's go now!"
HURLEY, Jack! Please tell me you're not actually considering this?
HURLEY," Jack! Dude we gotta go, the guy's crazy, and I know crazy!"
HURLEY, Dude you're gonna blow up!
HURLEY," No, I'm not going without you."
HURLEY," If you change your mind, I'll be like a mile away. "
HURLEY, Who's Ricardus?
HURLEY, You mean that figuratively right?
HURLEY," ¿Por qué? Que no sé. Sí, yo te puedo ayudar, pero yo no sé como encontrarlo si no sé cómo....  Why? I don't know. Yes, I can help you, but... I don't know how to find him."
HURLEY," Uh, what's who saying?"
HURLEY, I'm not talking to Jacob.
HURLEY," It's not Jacob, man!"
HURLEY," What offer, dude?"
HURLEY," Well, kind of."
HURLEY, Hey!
HURLEY, I was just trying--
HURLEY, Just calm down!
HURLEY, Your wife sent me.
HURLEY, I said your wife sent me. Isabella. She wants to know why you buried her cross.
HURLEY, Because she just told me.
HURLEY," Isabella saw you dig it up, man. She's standing right next to you."
HURLEY, A veces a las personas les toma un poco. Subtitle
HURLEY, She's right there. She says your English is awesome.
HURLEY," She wants you to close your eyes. It's okay, I'll tell you what she says."
HURLEY," No fue tu culpa que yo morí, Ricardo. Subtitle"
HURLEY, Yeah.
HURLEY," Yeah, you got it."
HURLEY, She kinda said one more thing. Something you have to do.
HURLEY, She said you have to stop the Man in Black. You have to stop him from leaving the island. 'Cause if you don't... todos nos vamos al infierno. Subtitle
HURLEY, Sorta.
HURLEY, I don't think she wants to come.
HURLEY, It's carousel four. 
HURLEY," You were on the Sydney flight, right?"
HURLEY," Our bags on carousel four, I double checked it with the dude at the counter. "
HURLEY," Pretty cool trophy, huh?"
HURLEY," Oh, you know we got the Human Fund next Saturday night... can you make it?"
HURLEY, Ma!
HURLEY, That's disgusting. And I'm too busy to meet someone...
HURLEY, I'm not scared!
HURLEY, I do?
HURLEY, What's she like?
HURLEY, Ma--
HURLEY, A lot of crazy stuff's been happening... I kind of wish I could talk to you about it in person. A lot of people come to talk to me after they've... you know... gone. It would be nice if you did too.
HURLEY, Where are you going?
HURLEY, You sure that's the right move?
HURLEY, Well... you're the expert.
HURLEY," Her name was Libby. She was in the tail section of the plane. We were gonna have our first date. It was gonna be, like... a picnic. But then she was murdered."
HURLEY," Yeah, me too..."
HURLEY, What are you doing here?
HURLEY, Why should I trust you? You murdered Libby and Ana Lucia.
HURLEY, What?
HURLEY, Um... no one.
HURLEY, Sure. Whatever...
HURLEY, Uh... can you leave those? I'm meeting someone. She's running late.
HURLEY, Uh... hi. Nice to meet you.
HURLEY, Wow! Uh... I wasn't expecting someone like you. 
HURLEY," You know, someone so... pretty. Please, have a seat."
HURLEY, You don't look like a Rosalita...
HURLEY, So... you're not my blind date?
HURLEY, Well... how did you know my name?
HURLEY, No I won't.
HURLEY, I guess...
HURLEY, Should I?
HURLEY," Actually, we just... wait, what? What's going on?"
HURLEY, Doctor?
HURLEY, Wandered off from where?
HURLEY," Um... I don't know if that's a good idea. I mean, for one thing, that stuff's really unstable. "
HURLEY, To blow stuff up?
HURLEY," Yeah, but how's blowing up the plane protecting us?"
HURLEY, Yeah... well neither will we. And then we'll be stuck here with it and it will be angry at us.
HURLEY," Well, Jacob never said anything about it to me. I mean... what if Richard's wrong?"
HURLEY," I think Richard's right. It's the only choice we've got. Trust me, Jack."
HURLEY, Give me a bucket. Family size.
HURLEY, What?
HURLEY, I own the place. Maybe you saw my commercial. You want a Cluckateer key chain?
HURLEY, Uh... yeah.
HURLEY," Wow, what a coincidence..."
HURLEY, Be my guest...
HURLEY, I eat when I'm depressed!
HURLEY, I met a girl on a blind date the other night.
HURLEY," Mmm, she's totally awesome... except for one thing. She's crazy!"
HURLEY," No, this one actually lives in the loony bin. I mean, I saw the van. She's full on nuts. I mean, she started sane... but then, she told me that we already knew each other. And that, I'd remember!"
HURLEY, Yeah. Kinda...
HURLEY, Run! Run! Go! Go! Go! Go!
HURLEY, I'm protecting us.
HURLEY," I did say ""Run."""
HURLEY, Michael told me to.
HURLEY," Michael. He's one of the people who come back and yell at me after they die. He told me I had to stop everyone from blowing up the plane. So...no dynamite, no more blowing up."
HURLEY, It happens enough.
HURLEY, Dead people are more reliable than alive people.
HURLEY, Want to ask you about that girl the other day. Libby? I was wondering if maybe I could see her.
HURLEY," Clearly, she's well enough for, like, a fajita field trip."
HURLEY, Her condition?
HURLEY, What do you mean?
HURLEY," You said ""probably"", which means you might make an exception."
HURLEY, Or a generous donor?
HURLEY, The rec room looked pretty gnarly on my way in. What do you think 100K might buy?
HURLEY, No. I'm sorry.
HURLEY, Where is it you think you know me from?
HURLEY, Try me.
HURLEY, What kind of memories?
HURLEY, And I was there?
HURLEY, Um... This is the first time I've ever been in a mental hospital.
HURLEY," I wish I could, Libby. But...I can't. I'm sorry."
HURLEY," Yeah, probably, but...we all got something, right? I mean, it takes a lot of guts to go up to a total stranger and tell them you know them from some bizarro alternate universe. I'm scared just saying ""hi"" to a girl."
HURLEY," Hey, can you ever like, like...get outta here? On day pass or..."
HURLEY, Well...would you like to do something?
HURLEY, Uh...yeah.
HURLEY, I know what we need to do.
HURLEY, We have to go talk to Locke.
HURLEY, It's not my idea. It's his.  Jacob says we have to talk to Locke.
HURLEY, Yeah.
HURLEY, What?
HURLEY," I don't have to prove anything to you, Richard. You either come with me or you can keep trying to blow stuff up. Your call, dude."
HURLEY, Really?
HURLEY," So what do you think we should...say to Locke when we get there? I mean, how do you break the ice with a smoke monster?"
HURLEY, Or he could just kill us all.
HURLEY, I didn't see Jacob back there. I just said it because I wanted everyone to listen to me.
HURLEY, Then why'd you come with me?
HURLEY," Unless you letting go gets us killed. Going to see Locke was my idea, not Jacob's. "
HURLEY," It's a good thing you do, dude, because I have no idea where I'm going."
HURLEY," Wait. It's cool, I think I know what these things are."
HURLEY, Wait here.
HURLEY," Hey, you around? Michael?"
HURLEY, You're stuck on the Island aren't you?
HURLEY," And...there're others out here like you, aren't there? That's what the whispers are?"
HURLEY, Do you know where Locke is?
HURLEY, Thanks. Is...is there anything I can do to...help you?
HURLEY, Okay.
HURLEY," I'll be sure and do that, dude."
HURLEY," I got like, six different kinds of cheeses. I don't even know what they are, but the lady at the store said they were good, so...figured you'd like cheese because...everybody likes cheese."
HURLEY, Something wrong?
HURLEY, Have you been here before?
HURLEY, No...not completely.
HURLEY, Why do you want to be with me? 
HURLEY, C'mon. Look at me.
HURLEY," Yeah but, you like me because...well...you're...delusional."
HURLEY," Whoa, dude. "
HURLEY, I...I think I'm remembering stuff.
HURLEY," No, I don't think you are."
HURLEY, Ummm...hey.
HURLEY," I don't know who you are, dude, or what you want, but we have to talk to you."
HURLEY," There are other people with me. The thing is...you got weapons and we got weapons, and I don't want anyone to get hurt...or killed. So, we're not gonna do anything. I want your word that you're not gonna do anything either."
HURLEY," Okay guys, come on out."
HURLEY,"  It's all you, dude."
HURLEY, Has he got a submarine?
HURLEY, Are we gonna tell Sun?
HURLEY, What about Sayid?
HURLEY," Yeah, but you can always bring people back from the dark side. I mean, Anakin--"
HURLEY," Hey, Claire."
HURLEY, You look great.
HURLEY, Who's she?
HURLEY, People trying to kill us again.
HURLEY, Yeah?
HURLEY," Um, I think we should stick to Sawyer's plan, or he'll be really pissed."
HURLEY, There they are!
HURLEY, Uh oh.
HURLEY, And we're dead...
HURLEY," Hurry! When that thing's done with them, he's coming for us!"
HURLEY," Well... wait, now he wants us to leave the Island?"
HURLEY," Dude, wait... he's not supposed to leave the island. I mean, Alpert said that--"
HURLEY," Jack, can't find first-aid kit, dude."
HURLEY," Dude, where did that come from?"
HURLEY, Dude how'd that get on the sub?
HURLEY, Uh...what?
HURLEY,  Sayid!
HURLEY, What happened? Did Sayid just...?
HURLEY, What about everybody else?
HURLEY, I have to go after Sayid!
HURLEY, Okay.
HURLEY, Is he okay?
HURLEY, Go where?
HURLEY, Yeah. I'm fine.
HURLEY, Ahh!
HURLEY, What? Who are you?
HURLEY, Why?
HURLEY, What do you want them for? 
HURLEY, Hey!
HURLEY, Dude...I've been waiting for you to show up. Where you been?
HURLEY, Did you see a kid run by here with your ashes? 
HURLEY," Uh, what?"
HURLEY," He's right there by the fire, he says hello..."
HURLEY," What, you can see him?"
HURLEY," Kate? Sawyer? You, too? "
HURLEY, Kate.
HURLEY, How about why you brought us to the Island?
HURLEY, So...how you gonna pick?
HURLEY, I'm just glad it's not me.
HURLEY," Sorry I'm late, dude."
HURLEY," Oh, hey, you didn't tell me Ana Lucia was gonna be here."
HURLEY," Oh, no. We never met. Anyways, here's your money. A hundred twenty-five grand, right?"
HURLEY, She's not coming with us?
HURLEY, I brought you my Camaro. The keys are under the floor mat. Everything else you need's in the trunk.
HURLEY, Absolutely.
HURLEY, And that Locke Smoke Thing wants to put it out?
HURLEY," So, what if he does?"
HURLEY," That's kinda of true, dude. He's worse than Yoda. "
HURLEY, I've got a bad feeling about this.
HURLEY," Yeah, yeah. Whatever, dude."
HURLEY," None of this is ringing a bell, is it? You me, tranquilizer gun?"
HURLEY," Okay, fine. I'm insane. Just wait here."
HURLEY," Then, that's your choice. But, if you stick with me...you'll be happy you did."
HURLEY," Uh, you have a concert to perform tonight, and I'm here to pick you up."
HURLEY," Charlie? Charlie, what if I told you that...playing this show is the most important thing you'll ever do? Would you come then?"
HURLEY," Okay, dude. Sorry about this. "
HURLEY, That was Charlie.
HURLEY, This would be so sweet if we weren't all about to die.
HURLEY, Whoa!
HURLEY," Jack. I believe in you, dude."
HURLEY, I'm not allowed to tell you.
HURLEY," There are rules, dude."
HURLEY," Don't worry about it. Just trust me, okay? I trust you."
HURLEY," I think you're a good guy, Sayid. You know, a lot of people have told you that you're not. Maybe you've heard it so many times you started believing it. You can't let other people tell you what you are, dude. You have to decide that for yourself."
HURLEY," I know a lot about you, dude."
HURLEY, Looks like a gnarly fight.
HURLEY, It takes as long as it takes.
HURLEY," Yeah, but dude, it was worth it."
HURLEY," Nah, let's give 'em a minute."
HURLEY, We have to try.
HURLEY," Uh-uh, no way. You think I'm going down that? I'm with you, dude."
HURLEY, How are we getting down there?
HURLEY," Dude, you can't go down there alone. If Desmond didn't make it, how the hell are you going to survive?"
HURLEY," No. No way, I'm not gonna let you die."
HURLEY, You said you'd protect the Island!
HURLEY, You're committing suicide!
HURLEY, You're not supposed to die! The Island needs you!
HURLEY, What?
HURLEY,  I can't... it's supposed to be you!
HURLEY," Alright I'll take it. But it's only temporary, as soon as you get that light back in, I'm pulling you up, and I'm giving it right back to you, deal?!"
HURLEY, Is that it?
HURLEY, Easy. Easy. Easy.
HURLEY," Dude, pull!"
HURLEY," Hang on, Jack!"
