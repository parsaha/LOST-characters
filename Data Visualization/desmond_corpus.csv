DESMOND," You alright, brother? "
DESMOND," Take it easy. Keep the weight off. Here, let me have a look. Does this hurt?  You haven't sprained it then. I don't fancy your chances of catching up with me tonight, though."
DESMOND," Aye, of course you weren't. "
DESMOND, I was almost a doctor once. 
DESMOND, You a doctor then?  So what's your excuse? 
DESMOND, For running like the devil's chasing you. My excuse - I'm training.
DESMOND," For a race around the world. Impressive, I know. So your excuse better be good, brother. "
DESMOND," Ah, a girl, right? "
DESMOND," Ah, but a girl patient. What's her name? "
DESMOND, What'd you do to her then? 
DESMOND, You must have done something worthy of this self-flagellation. 
DESMOND," Well, right. Just one thing -- what if you did fix her?"
DESMOND, But what if you did? 
DESMOND, I don't? Why not?
DESMOND," Oh, and you don't believe in miracles?  Right. Well then, I'm going to give you some advice anyway. You have to lift it up. (He may be saying ""lift her up"".)"
DESMOND, Your ankle. You've got to keep it elevated. It's been nice chatting. 
DESMOND," Jack, I'm Desmond. Good luck, brother. See you in another life, yeah? "
DESMOND, Are you him? Are you him?
DESMOND, Are you -- are you him?
DESMOND, I can't believe it. You're finally here.
DESMOND, Who's she?
DESMOND, What did one snowman say to the other snowman?
DESMOND, Get rid of the knife. You're not him. 
DESMOND," Yeah, then why did you come?"
DESMOND, Were you now? And when was that?
DESMOND, 44 days? Move.
DESMOND, Shut it.  Tie him up. Do it!
DESMOND," How's that, brother?"
DESMOND," So, what does that make you then, brother? "
DESMOND," All right then, box man, tie her up. "
DESMOND," Hey! You be good girl, right? "
DESMOND," Alright, bring her here. "
DESMOND, So you were traveling from Sydney to Los Angeles?
DESMOND, So the world is still out there? 
DESMOND, My name? My name is Desmond.
DESMOND," Yeah, so I should just hand it over to you then, should I? How many of you are there?"
DESMOND, A raft?
DESMOND, How many of your group have gotten sick.
DESMOND," Sick, as in ill, as in dead!"
DESMOND, Answer the question.
DESMOND," Get up.  Stand right there. Do you know how to use this, box man? "
DESMOND, Do you know how to use it?!
DESMOND, Sit!
DESMOND," Listen carefully, type in exactly what I tell you understand -- exactly, nothing else. 4, 8, 15... Did you hear that?"
DESMOND, What did you just put in? What number did you just put in?!
DESMOND," Right, 16, 23, 42. Now press execute. "
DESMOND, Just push it!
DESMOND, Who the hell is that?
DESMOND, Who is he?
DESMOND, What is he doing here?
DESMOND," Your doctor has a gun, brother.  Move.  Make one sound and I'll shoot. Move."
DESMOND,  Move and I kill him. Put the gun down.
DESMOND, I said drop it.
DESMOND, Do you want him to die? Put it down.
DESMOND,"  Lower your gun or I'll blow his damned head off, brother!"
DESMOND, Do you want him to die? Put it down.
DESMOND, Lower your gun or I'll blow his damned head off.
DESMOND, What did you do? What did you do? We're all going to die. We're all going to die.
DESMOND,  I have to fix it.
DESMOND," Listen, if you do not let me up, we are going to die..."
DESMOND, Look at the wall! You see that?! That's a timer! It's counting down! I've got to enter the code! I've got to push the button! 
DESMOND, Do I know you?
DESMOND, Bastard.
DESMOND," Can you fix a computer?  Then you can't help me, can you?"
DESMOND," Down the corridor to the left. Be persistent, the wheel sticks.  Gotcha."
DESMOND," Please, just let me..."
DESMOND," It was 3 years ago. I was on a solo race around the world, and my boat crashed into the reef, and then Kelvin came."
DESMOND," Kelvin -- he comes running out of the jungle -- hurry, hurry, come with me. He brings me down here. The first thing he does -- because there's beeping already -- he types in the code, he pushes the button, and it stops. What was all that about, I say. Just saving the world, he says. "
DESMOND," His words, not mine. So I started pushing the button, too. And we saved the world together for awhile, and that was lovely. Then Kelvin died, and now here I am all alone. The end."
DESMOND, You don't have to take my word for it. Watch the film. 
DESMOND," The bookcase -- top shelf, behind ""Turn of the Screw"" -- projector's in the pantry."
DESMOND, Do you think I'd be here if I was?
DESMOND, I push this button every 108 minutes. I don't get out much. 
DESMOND, Kelvin died waiting for his replacements.
DESMOND, Why wouldn't it be?
DESMOND," Every -- single -- day. And for all our sakes, I hope it's not real. But the film says this is an electromagnetic station. And I don't know about you, brother, but every time I walk past that concrete wall out there, my fillings hurt.  Right.  Oh no. "
DESMOND, It's over. 
DESMOND, Give him my best.
DESMOND," As far as I can run, brother."
DESMOND," Oh, right. The code, yeah?"
DESMOND," Listen carefully. If by some miracle you manage to get the computer working again you've got to enter the code 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, hit execute. Again 4, 8, 15-"
DESMOND, Sorry?
DESMOND," In about 15 minutes you're either going to be very right, or very wrong, brother. You want to shoot me?! Shoot me! But I'm not-"
DESMOND," I remember you -- running -- I know you -- I met you -- Los Angeles. I was training, yeah? You twisted your ankle..."
DESMOND," You're a doctor, right? There was this girl -- you were worried -- you said, you said you failed her. That was you. "
DESMOND," Was she okay, the girl?"
DESMOND, What happened to her?
DESMOND, How can you say it doesn't matter?
DESMOND," Right, and you're -- you're not married to her anymore, then?"
DESMOND," See you in another life, yeah? "
DESMOND, You. 
DESMOND,"  Do you think I did it on purpose? I was sailing for two and half weeks, bearing due West and making 9 knots. I should have been in Fiji in less than a week. But the first piece of land I saw wasn't Fiji, was it? No. No, it was here—this, this island. And you know why? Because this is it. This is all there is left. This ocean and this place here. We are stuck in a bloody snow globe! There's no outside world! There's no escape! So, just go away, huh. Let me drink. "
DESMOND, Are you still pushing it? 
DESMOND," To avoid temptation, brother. I've read everything Mr. Charles Dickens has ever written - every wonderful word. Every book except this one. I'm saving it so it will be the last thing I ever read before I die. "
DESMOND, Not with you.
DESMOND, Did you bring me a present?
DESMOND," You're a bastard, you know that? "
DESMOND, Is it now?
DESMOND, And what makes you think I would just run away?
DESMOND," I wouldn't waste your time. There's nothing out there, pal. "
DESMOND," Going to see the hostiles, are you?"
DESMOND," You know what, ignorance is bliss. The boat's all yours, brother, for all the good it'll do you. "
DESMOND, Then I suggest you find someone who does.
DESMOND," Just give me which ever one has the most caffeine in it, brother.  Damn, um, I'm sorry. I've just arrived and I spent all my American money on a taxi. "
DESMOND, That's not necessary.
DESMOND," I don't suppose you have 42,000 more of those do you? "
DESMOND, I was joking.
DESMOND," I have 8 months to get into the best shape of my life. I'll tell you what, miss, I'm going to win."
DESMOND, What really matters is who I win it for. 
DESMOND," He tried to buy me off. And when I didn't take his money, he took away the only thing in the world that I ever truly cared about. "
DESMOND, His daughter. I was unsuitable on several levels. 
DESMOND," It's a wee bit complicated. As of yet, I don't actually have a boat.  Sorry, did I say something wrong? "
DESMOND, I'm sorry.
DESMOND," I can't take your boat, miss."
DESMOND, What was your husband's name?
DESMOND, And what did he name his boat?
DESMOND," Then I thank you, Elizabeth. And I shall win this race for love."
DESMOND,"  You're wasting your time, sister. I shot myself with that stuff every 9 days for 3 years.  He's lovely. Is the father here on the Island? "
DESMOND," Well, maybe he knew he'd be a lousy dad—thought he was doing what was best for you. "
DESMOND, How did you find me?
DESMOND, How did you find me? 
DESMOND, Not yet.
DESMOND," I was in prison, not away."
DESMOND," When are you getting married, Pen? "
DESMOND, I'll be back in a year.
DESMOND," I'm going to win this race, Pen—his race. And in a year, I'll be back. "
DESMOND," I have to get my honor back, and that's what I'm running to. "
DESMOND, Smells like carrots.
DESMOND," Hello yourself, box man."
DESMOND," Oh, I insist. So you managed to fix the computer, then, did you? "
DESMOND," I'm not so sure about that, brother. "
DESMOND, 3 years. 
DESMOND, I'd ask you how the hell did you know something like that? 
DESMOND, You're lying.
DESMOND," You're so sure it's not real, then just stop pushing the button!"
DESMOND," Are you sure about this, brother?"
DESMOND," Alright then, box man. We wait."
DESMOND, What? 
DESMOND, What are you talking about? Who are you?
DESMOND," What, what happened to my boat?"
DESMOND," What was all that about, then? "
DESMOND, Why are there missing parts?
DESMOND, Who's Radzinsky?
DESMOND, And what happened to him?
DESMOND, Why do you wear that suit? 
DESMOND," Who is he, box man—the man out there pounding on the door?"
DESMOND, Why does Mr. Eko carry around a stick covered in scripture?
DESMOND, We locked out a priest?
DESMOND," It would take an atom bomb, brother. Tell him not to bother. "
DESMOND," Aye, I'm sure."
DESMOND, Maybe you should do it?
DESMOND, How do you even remember where you left off from? 
DESMOND," Yeah, right, Radzinsky. Radzinsky figured out how to fake a lockdown. Radzinsky created this great invisible map. More and more tales about your former partner. Yet for some reason, you never want to tell me what bloody well happened to him. "
DESMOND," Well, if you don't want me to go crazy, next time let me go out. "
DESMOND," I haven't been outside for 2 bloody years! Yes, I want to go! I was in the army for God's sake!"
DESMOND," Why did you leave your army, Kelvin, huh? "
DESMOND," Please, Kelvin. Let me go out, huh? Just once."
DESMOND," Kelvin! Hey, Kelvin."
DESMOND, What is this? 
DESMOND, What are you talking about?
DESMOND," What's behind that wall, Kelvin? Huh? What was the incident?"
DESMOND," Why make us do it—push the button? If we, if we can just..."
DESMOND," I think your friends just blew themselves up, brother."
DESMOND, I can't hear anything. Maybe we should open it. 
DESMOND, A trick? They could be hurt! Is your doctor around? 
DESMOND," Can I ask you a question, brother? "
DESMOND," Is the reason you're letting that clock there run all the way down to the very last tick—is it because you need to look down the barrel of a gun to find out what you really believe, John? "
DESMOND, Tell me about this other hatch you found—this Pearl.
DESMOND, Details.
DESMOND, What if you've got it backwards?
DESMOND," What if the experiment wasn't on the two men in here, but on the two men in there? I want to see that tape, John."
DESMOND," Well, was there anything else in that station? Was there a computer?"
DESMOND, So what did it do?! 
DESMOND," What printout, where is it?"
DESMOND," I'm never going to let go, brother. "
DESMOND, Goodbye?
DESMOND, What are you doing with my boat? 
DESMOND, You were leaving?
DESMOND, Come where?! What about the button?!
DESMOND, That's not what you said when you were going on and on about dams and electromagnetics and failsafes!
DESMOND, Why did you lie to me?!
DESMOND, You crazy old bastard! You stole my life!!
DESMOND, What else did you lie to me about?! What else? Tell me?!
DESMOND, How could you do this to me?! Get up. 
DESMOND, Oh my God. Oh my God. 
DESMOND, When did you come here?
DESMOND, The Island—when did you come here? How long ago?
DESMOND, The date—what was the date?
DESMOND, I think I crashed your plane.
DESMOND, We need to push the button.
DESMOND," Do you not hear me, brother? I crashed your bloody plane?"
DESMOND," On that day, those numbers turned to hieroglyphics. And when the last one came down this whole place started to shake! And that screen? That screen filled up with ""system failure,""  System Failure! And I know what they are. 92204—September the 22nd, 2004, the day your planed crashed! It's real! It's all bloody real!! Now, push the damn button!!"
DESMOND, You don't want to push the button? Then I will. 
DESMOND, You killed us. You killed us all. 
DESMOND," I'm trying, brother. "
DESMOND, It's all gone. It's all gone!!
DESMOND," 3 days before you came down here, before we met, I heard a banging on the Hatch door, shouting. But it was you, John, wasn't it? You said there isn't any purpose—there's no such thing as fate. But you saved my life, brother, so that I could save yours. "
DESMOND, I've got to go. And you've got to get as far away from here as possible. 
DESMOND," I'm going to blow the dam, John.  I'm sorry for whatever happened that made you stop believing. But it's all real. Now I've got to go and make it all go away. "
DESMOND," I'll see you in another life, brother. "
DESMOND,"  I love you, Penny."
DESMOND," You alone, brother? "
DESMOND, Beach camp's right over there. Can you get me some clothes? 
DESMOND, I woke up in the jungle like this. 
DESMOND,"  Fine, you want to discuss this in great detail right now?! Let's do it."
DESMOND, It was a failsafe key.
DESMOND, I'm sorry?
DESMOND, I didn't know what would happen. 
DESMOND, The failsafe key must have detonated the electromagnetic anomaly -- made the hatch implode. 
DESMOND, No.
DESMOND," I'm afraid I missed that, brother."
DESMOND, Don't worry. Locke's going to go after them. He said so in his speech. 
DESMOND," Right. Right, of course. I'm sorry. I'm just a bit shook up. "
DESMOND," You've, um, you've got a problem with your roof."
DESMOND," Look, maybe you should move down the beach, just for tonight. That way I can fix it -- make some improvements."
DESMOND," No, it'll be worth it. I promise."
DESMOND, I was just offering to fix this roof here.
DESMOND," Right, well, just trying to help, huh."
DESMOND," Don't mind me, brother. I'm just going to take one of your clubs. Hurley said it would be alright."
DESMOND," So, uh, I can take one of these?"
DESMOND," Thanks, mate.  You know, you might want to square your shoulders a bit more."
DESMOND, I'm Scottish. Cheers. 
DESMOND, Nope. Just an experiment.
DESMOND," Thanks, I'm not hungry.  You might want to wait a minute."
DESMOND, Is that supposed to hurt my feelings? 
DESMOND, The computer in the hatch wasn't only for pushing the button. I'm pretty sure... it could be used to communicate with other stations. 
DESMOND," Would you mind if I asked you a question, Brother? "
DESMOND," Are we off to poke at a computer, or are we going after your man Eko?"
DESMOND," Well, that's quite a coincidence. "
DESMOND, Are we?
DESMOND,  Charlie. 
DESMOND, I need you to come with me. 
DESMOND, Both of you.
DESMOND,  I've got her. 
DESMOND,  Just stand back; give me some room!
DESMOND," Get back, Charlie; I know what I'm doing. "
DESMOND, Come on; come on.
DESMOND, Are you alright? Come on; you're okay. Let's get you back to the tent. 
DESMOND,"  It's alright, Charlie.  Alright, let's get her back to her tent. "
DESMOND," I got it, Charlie. "
DESMOND," Aye, thanks. "
DESMOND," Penny, well, Penelope. How are you feeling?"
DESMOND, It's my pleasure. 
DESMOND, Aye.
DESMOND, No harm done. 
DESMOND," Thanks, but no. I've spent a wee bit too much time drunk as of late. "
DESMOND, What kind of whiskey is that? 
DESMOND,"  Alright then, let's have it.  No, the bottle, brother. I mean, if you've come to drink, let's drink. "
DESMOND, Cheers. 
DESMOND, Cheers. 
DESMOND," Anything, pal. "
DESMOND, I could hear her calling for help. 
DESMOND," Well, I suppose I've -- I've got good hearing. "
DESMOND, Excuse me? 
DESMOND,"  Thanks for the drink, pal. "
DESMOND,  You don't want to know what happened to me when I turned that key!
DESMOND, You don't want to know! And I don't want to know! 
DESMOND, You don't want to know!!
DESMOND," I'll see you in another life, brother."
DESMOND," I love you, Penny."
DESMOND,  What's happening? 
DESMOND, This is my flat? 
DESMOND, Absolutely nothing. 
DESMOND, Thanks.
DESMOND, Have I? 
DESMOND," Well, my severe head injury is a small price to pay for the pleasure of having you move into my humble -- is rat trap accurate?"
DESMOND, It's not about the job. I want him to respect me. 
DESMOND, What did you say? 
DESMOND," Yeah, yeah, I'm fine -- just had a bit of a deja vu, that's all. "
DESMOND," Good afternoon, uh, I'm here to see Mr. Widmore. "
DESMOND," Hume, uh, Mr. Desmond Hume. "
DESMOND," Excuse me, what did you say?"
DESMOND, Thank you.
DESMOND," No, it was actually set design for the Royal Shakespeare Company. "
DESMOND," No, sir. I had to look after my 3 brothers after my father--"
DESMOND," No, sir.  She's beautiful -- your boat."
DESMOND," No. No, sir. "
DESMOND," With all due respect, sir, I haven't come here to interview for a position in your company. "
DESMOND," No, sir. I came here to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage. We've been together 2 years now and Pen's moving in and I love her. Your permission would mean everything to me. "
DESMOND," No, I'm afraid not, sir. "
DESMOND," Mr. Widmore, I know I'm not..."
DESMOND, I know you? How do I know you?
DESMOND, How do I know you?
DESMOND, Where do I know you from?
DESMOND, You're Charlie. 
DESMOND,  Who -- they -- they. It -- it was in the hatch. I remember seeing you. There was a -- there was a computer. There was a button. We -- we were on an island. 
DESMOND,"  No, it was real, man. I remember!"
DESMOND, No this -- I remember this. This all happened before! Today -- th -- th -- this happened today. This -- I remember that he said I wasn't worthy -- and then I -- and then I -- and then I came down and I -- and I took off my tie and I -- and then I lost my tie and Penny said where was it and then it started to rain and...
DESMOND,  Donovan!
DESMOND,  I need to ask you something.
DESMOND, What do you know about time travel?
DESMOND, Just tell me if it's possible? 
DESMOND," You know what? Forget you're my best mate, right? As a physicist -- is it possible that I've somehow managed to go back in time and I'm now living my life over again?  It's not funny, Donovan."
DESMOND," These things are not in my head, brother. I remember things. "
DESMOND," It doesn't work like that. I don't remember everything, just -- just bits and pieces. "
DESMOND," Wait, I remember this. I know this song. The jukebox..."
DESMOND," I remember this night.  Graybridge come back from 2 goals down in the final 2 minutes and win this game. It's a bloody miracle. And after they win, Jimmy Lennon's going to come through that door and hit the bartender right in the head with a cricket bat because he owes him money. "
DESMOND," Watch, please! Just watch.  They'll score the first goal right now.  No, no, they came back. They won. Jimmy Lennon ... cricket bat. "
DESMOND, That's because I was at the pub. 
DESMOND, Nope. 
DESMOND, Your father was lovely. We just both agree that I wasn't exactly qualified. 
DESMOND, I don't think my failure to impress your father is any occasion to celebrate. 
DESMOND, Why? Why do you love me? 
DESMOND, I'm right here.
DESMOND, Is it that obvious?
DESMOND, I'm not a man of means...
DESMOND, I hope to -- one day...
DESMOND, I'll take it. 
DESMOND, It's perfect. I'll take it.
DESMOND, I don't understand.
DESMOND, I don't know what you're on about.
DESMOND, How do you know my name? 
DESMOND, Who are you? 
DESMOND, What?
DESMOND," So, what then? "
DESMOND," This isn't really happening, is it?"
DESMOND, I've had a concussion. You're my subconscious. 
DESMOND," You're here to talk me out of marrying Penny. Well, it won't bloody work. "
DESMOND," No, there is no island. There is no button. It's madness. I love her. She loves me. I'm going to spend the rest of my life with her. "
DESMOND," Oh, my God. You knew that was going to happen, didn't you?  Then why didn't you stop it? Why didn't you do anything? "
DESMOND, I'm going to meet Penny in an hour. I've got the ring; she'll say yes; I can choose whatever I want. 
DESMOND, How much for the ring? 
DESMOND, Hi.
DESMOND, Right on time.
DESMOND," No thanks, mate. "
DESMOND," Ah, I love the Alps."
DESMOND,  I couldn't go through with it.
DESMOND, I can't do this. 
DESMOND, Us. This. This relationship. 
DESMOND, How can I? I - I can't look after you. I haven't got a job. I don't have any -- I can't even afford 5 quid for a bloody photograph. You deserve someone better. 
DESMOND, Love's not enough. Being a good man is not enough. 
DESMOND," It's all happening too soon -- you moving in. You're painting rooms; you're changing things. I don't even like red. Why would you leave your flat, your expensive flat--"
DESMOND," I'm sorry, Pen, but this -- we're not supposed to be together. "
DESMOND, Just give me a pint of your cheapest. I'm celebrating. 
DESMOND, I think I've made the biggest mistake of my life. And the worst part is I'm pretty sure I've made it before. 
DESMOND, Do they now? 
DESMOND,  I had the wrong night. I was right. I was off by a night. I heard the song and then -- I remember this. I'm not crazy. I can still change things. I can still change it. 
DESMOND, Jimmy Lennon. 
DESMOND,"  Hey, duck brother!"
DESMOND," Oh, no. Oh. "
DESMOND,"  Please, let me go back. Let me go back one more time. I'll do it right. I'll do it right this time. I'm sorry, Penny. I'll change it. I'll change it. "
DESMOND, I could hear her calling for help. 
DESMOND, You don't want to know what happened to me when I turned that key! You don't want to know!
DESMOND, You don't want to know what happened to me! You don't want to know!
DESMOND,  You don't want to know. No matter what you do...
DESMOND,  You can't change it. You can't change it no matter what you try to do. You just can't change it.
DESMOND," You're a good man, Charlie. Listen, I'm sorry I tried to strangle you, alright?"
DESMOND," No, you're right, pal. "
DESMOND," When I turned that key my life flashed before my eyes. And then I was back in the jungle and still on this bloody island. But those flashes, Charlie -- those flashes -- they didn't stop. "
DESMOND," I wasn't saving Claire, Charlie, I was saving you. This morning you dove in after Claire. You tried to save her but you drowned. "
DESMOND," When I saw the lightning hit the roof you were electrocuted. And when you heard Claire was in the water you -- you drowned trying to save her. I dove in myself so you never went in. I've tried, brother. I've tried twice to save you, but the universe has a way of course correcting and -- and I can't stop it forever. I'm sorry. I'm sorry because no matter what I try to do you're going to die, Charlie."
DESMOND, When's what going to happen?
DESMOND, I was drunk. Now if I said anything...
DESMOND, It doesn't work like that.
DESMOND," Aye, apologies for the scotch, mate."
DESMOND," Well, to be fair there was -- there was 3 of us."
DESMOND, Good morning.
DESMOND, Boar running thick. I was hoping you might want to join me in a hunt.
DESMOND," I think hunting might be a better way to spend your day, Charlie. I mean of all the things you could choose to do today, hunting with me might be your best option."
DESMOND," Look, I'm sorry. "
DESMOND," I'm sorry, man. "
DESMOND, I said I'm sorry. 
DESMOND," Look I was shooting at a boar, I had no idea you were out here."
DESMOND," He's back at the camp, look I'm really sorry."
DESMOND, Aye it's just me.
DESMOND," I was following a boar, Claire."
DESMOND, It got away.
DESMOND, Why wouldn't I want you to catch the birds?
DESMOND, You followed me. Stay back!
DESMOND, Stay back!
DESMOND, I didn't.
DESMOND, How would I?
DESMOND, See that spot over there?  That's where Charlie slipped and fell. He got pounded again and again by the rocks and broke his neck.
DESMOND, That's where Charlie died.
DESMOND, Aye. Tragic. 
DESMOND, How do you mean? 
DESMOND, Doesn't work like that. I only see flashes. 
DESMOND, I do know that she was with your mate this morning. 
DESMOND," I saw her with your boy Sawyer. The dead girl, Nikki. "
DESMOND, Then why was she yelling at him? 
DESMOND, Aye. 
DESMOND, Right before she died. 
DESMOND," You asked me to help you catch a boar. Well, this is when they break cover to eat. "
DESMOND," So what's your angle, brother?"
DESMOND," Well, you... haven't spoken three words to me and then, suddenly you want to be my hunting partner."
DESMOND, Shh. 
DESMOND," Claire, you don't look so good. "
DESMOND, Where did Locke go?
DESMOND," Don't, don't touch it."
DESMOND," Just breathe, just breathe huh."
DESMOND, Don't try to talk mate. We've gotta get back.
DESMOND, I can't help!  I'm sorry mate.
DESMOND, Hey. Where's the wire?
DESMOND," Listen to me, there's a wire, a cable buried in the sand. Do you know what I'm talking about?"
DESMOND," The cable, do you know where it is?! This is important."
DESMOND,  Because someone's coming.
DESMOND," Thank you, brother."
DESMOND," Morning, Jack. Must be nice to wake up in your own bed."
DESMOND," Listen, I was wondering if I could borrow your first-aid kit. Er, twisted my ankle."
DESMOND," Nah, you're alright. I've taped my share of ankles."
DESMOND, Thanks.
DESMOND, Absolutely.
DESMOND, What the hell was that? Do you want him to get suspicious?
DESMOND, No. It's just a precaution.
DESMOND, I saw a sequence of events. Things that are gonna happen. 
DESMOND," It was, it was like a sorta jigsaw puzzle. Only I didn't have the picture in the box, so I dunno how the pieces fit exactly, but... but one of the pieces, the first one..."
DESMOND," ... It was you, pulling the cable out the sand. "
DESMOND," If I tell you that, it'll change the picture in the box."
DESMOND, Not this time.
DESMOND, More than anything.
DESMOND, Because he was there with us.
DESMOND,  That's right.
DESMOND, Aye.
DESMOND, That'd be the long and short of it. But I've no bloody idea how I'm gonna get him to come with us.
DESMOND,"  Good man. Get food, water."
DESMOND, We need one more.
DESMOND, Someone's coming to the Island.
DESMOND, Can't tell ya.
DESMOND," Well, you're a part of it, yeah. As are Jin and Hurley."
DESMOND," Well, that's not gonna happen. Not this time."
DESMOND,  Absolutely.
DESMOND," But, how can you tell?"
DESMOND, Where is it then?
DESMOND,  Cut her down!
DESMOND," We're not going in the jungle, well, not yet. It's getting late, so we'll, er, we'll camp here the night."
DESMOND, Soon.
DESMOND," Used to being quiet, I suppose."
DESMOND," Moriah. I find the name the brothers have chosen for the wine made here, interesting."
DESMOND," Well, Moriah's the mountain where Abraham was asked to kill Isaac. It's not exactly the most... festive locale, is it?"
DESMOND," Well, one might argue then, God may not have asked Abraham to sacrifice his son in the first place."
DESMOND," Forgive me, brother."
DESMOND, Thanks.
DESMOND, Her name's Penny.
DESMOND, Because I'm a coward.
DESMOND," You and me both pal. You know, I tried to run away from her, and she, she tracked me down. With enough money and determination, you can find anyone, she said. And I used to wake up at nights, thinking if she actually meant it, that she never gave up, that maybe she's spent the last three years looking for me. "
DESMOND, No.
DESMOND, Oh my god.
DESMOND," Out to where it fell. Come on, let's go."
DESMOND, Yes we are.
DESMOND, She can't wait.
DESMOND," They. Whoever it is... could be hurt. We have to go, all four of us, now."
DESMOND, Because that's the way its supposed to happen.
DESMOND,  We'll leave at first light then. Together.
DESMOND, Is your sister in?
DESMOND," Hello, Ruth."
DESMOND," Well, technically, I'm still what they call a novice, 'til the abbey..."
DESMOND," Well, now that my initiation's done, I felt like I owed you an explanation."
DESMOND, I had a calling.
DESMOND," OK, yes, I was scared about the wedding, so I had a few pints too many, maybe, and I... I raised my eyes, and I asked, am I doing the right thing, and that's the last thing I remember. And when I woke up, I was lying on my back in the street, and I dunno how I got there, and... there was this man standing over me, Ruth. And he reached out his hand, and he said to me, ""Can I help you brother?"". And the first thing I noticed was the rope tied round his waist, and... I looked at him... and I knew. I knew... I was supposed to go with him. I was supposed to leave everything that mattered behind, sacrifice all of it... for a greater calling."
DESMOND, Next?
DESMOND,"  That's it, there is no next. We find the beacon."
DESMOND," Look, mate. I've saved your life three times now. If that hasn't bought me your trust, I don't know what will. Let's move."
DESMOND," Actually you're not. And if you don't get a move on, we're not gonna make it before nightfall—"
DESMOND, Don't move.
DESMOND, Oh my god.
DESMOND, Who?
DESMOND, Earlier I hoped it. Now I know it.
DESMOND, Would you come if I had?
DESMOND, I didn't wanna tell you because... I didn't want anything to change.
DESMOND,  Right.
DESMOND,  Right.
DESMOND,"  Well it's a grand old team to play for, and it's a grand old team to see. And if you know your history, it's..."
DESMOND," Well, I believe I'm... getting pissed on our lovely wine."
DESMOND," Well, it's just as well we've taken a vow of poverty then, isn't it?"
DESMOND, Right.
DESMOND," Well... ah, you know, I, I've had a tough week. I'm sorry for the wine. I'll take the penance. "
DESMOND, Brother Desmond.
DESMOND, Are you firing me?
DESMOND," You can't do that, I heard the call."
DESMOND," Oh aye, I'm sure he does."
DESMOND, Hey. What am I supposed to do now?
DESMOND," Hey, we'll move faster if we stop talking. She might be hurt."
DESMOND," Ahh, Charlie, duck!"
DESMOND," No, the beacon fell this side of the rise."
DESMOND, Sorry.
DESMOND, Aye.
DESMOND," Because if I'd told you the truth, you wouldn't have come!"
DESMOND," If the flashes don't happen exactly how I saw them, the picture changes. I was supposed to let you die, Charlie."
DESMOND," It means it's bloody pointless. I keep saving your life, and what good has it done? Its just gonna keep happening again and again, maybe that's the point, eh? Maybe it's a test."
DESMOND," Like God testing Abraham, except I failed, because I changed what I saw."
DESMOND," I'm sorry, Penny. I'm sorry."
DESMOND, No.
DESMOND, I nearly took this with me.
DESMOND, Absolutely.
DESMOND," You better drive safe, Miss. This vineyard only makes a limited number of these cases each year."
DESMOND," Aye, it's 'cause the monks are lazy."
DESMOND," Yeah, its easier making grape jelly than wine. "
DESMOND, Cause I'm an ex-monk.
DESMOND, As of last night. I was fired. 
DESMOND," Oh, it wasn't that funny. "
DESMOND," Oh, they can. You know, I was told under no uncertain terms that the abbey wasn't where I was meant to end up. It's just a... step along a path. You know, God allegedly has bigger plans for me."
DESMOND, I suspect that's because I don't.
DESMOND, Did I say I was coming to Carlisle with you?
DESMOND," You know, I don't usually get into cars with strangers."
DESMOND," Desmond. Very nice to meet you, Penny."
DESMOND," Stand back! Get away from her! I'm here, I'm here, Penny."
DESMOND," Just get off, Charlie! Sorry Penny, I'm sorry."
DESMOND, I've no idea.
DESMOND, I've never seen her before in my life.
DESMOND,  Give me a hand.
DESMOND, Don't know.
DESMOND," Wait, you understand her then?"
DESMOND, Oh god!
DESMOND," Right, get her pack! We haven't got much in this first-aid kit. See if there's anything we can use in there."
DESMOND,  Just go and start looking!
DESMOND," No, if we move her, it'll make it worse."
DESMOND," No, we... we need to bring Jack here."
DESMOND, Then I'll run.
DESMOND, Nobody knows we're here!
DESMOND," No, you'll just make it worse."
DESMOND," Lest you forget, she said my bloody name! She had a photo of me and my girlfriend. Do I understand?! I understand better than the lot of you!"
DESMOND, We've wasted enough time already. 
DESMOND," Just get out of my way, Charlie."
DESMOND," Hey, Jin!"
DESMOND, Jin!
DESMOND," Who are you?  I said, who are you?!"
DESMOND," You've got five seconds to talk, or I fire this gun brother."
DESMOND, And how do you think it'll feel? Taking a flare to the chest at this range.
DESMOND, You understand her.
DESMOND, I'm saving her.
DESMOND," Well, do it. Help her."
DESMOND,  What you need?
DESMOND, I'll do it.
DESMOND," Yeah, I heard ya!"
DESMOND, Is that... normal?
DESMOND, What did she say?
DESMOND, Just go.
DESMOND, So what would you have me do Charlie? We gotta make a stretcher and carry her. How we gonna do that and bring a prisoner?
DESMOND," No, Jin."
DESMOND," Jin, it's all right!"
DESMOND, Jin! Come back here!
DESMOND," Jin, it's all right, Jin!"
DESMOND," Jin, let him go! Jin, let go!"
DESMOND," Charlie, don't, Charlie!"
DESMOND," Charlie, let him go!"
DESMOND," We gave him our word!  Go on, get out of here."
DESMOND, What's that?
DESMOND," You know brother, by my count, you've killed more of them than they've killed of you."
DESMOND," Can you give me your word that Jack can be trusted? Now, he spent 10 days with those people and then nothing happened to him? And that woman he's spending all his time with—"
DESMOND," Aye, Juliet. Two weeks ago she had your friends in cages. Naomi... I mean, you heard everything that she said. If we keep her safe, she's our way off this Island. So given that, do you trust Jack? Or don't you?"
DESMOND, Right. So you better bring us someone we can trust.
DESMOND, No.
DESMOND," Oh I dunno, I could murder some haggis right now."
DESMOND, Nothing.
DESMOND," No, Charlie. I didn't."
DESMOND," Er, sorry. Er, Charlie. Can you give me a hand with something?"
DESMOND, Aye. 
DESMOND," What I saw, Charlie, was Claire and her baby getting into a helicopter. A helicopter that lifts off — leaves this Island."
DESMOND, Aye.
DESMOND," You are, Charlie."
DESMOND," If you don't, none of it will happen. There won't be any rescue. I'm sorry, brother, but this time — this time you have to die."
DESMOND, What are you writing?
DESMOND, You sure you wanna know? I mean it might be easier if you jus—
DESMOND," You're inside a hatch. It's, er... a room full of equipment. There's a blinking yellow light above a switch. You flick the switch... light goes off... and then you drown."
DESMOND, I don't know.
DESMOND, Aye.
DESMOND, That's right.
DESMOND, I'll go with him.
DESMOND," It's a weight belt. Should bring you down quicker than swimming. Well, every second counts."
DESMOND, So how long can you really hold your breath for?
DESMOND, This is it. Ready?
DESMOND, We're here.
DESMOND,  What is it?
DESMOND, You don't have to do this Charlie.
DESMOND, I'll go.
DESMOND, Maybe I keep seeing you die because I'm supposed to take your place.
DESMOND," What about your girl? Besides, I might be luckier than you. Keep your memories to yourself. I'll take it from here."
DESMOND," Well, you could tell me where the, er, weigh belt is."
DESMOND," You're inside a room full of equipment. There's a blinking yellow light, above a switch..."
DESMOND," ... You flick the switch, light goes off. Then you drown."
DESMOND, Charlie! Bloody hell! You all right?
DESMOND, Hey!
DESMOND," She's not gonna tell you, brother."
DESMOND, What makes you say that?
DESMOND, Aye. There's plenty.
DESMOND," All right, mate."
DESMOND, Aye?
DESMOND," No, nothing."
DESMOND, Aye.
DESMOND, Penny!!! NO!
DESMOND, Charlie!!!
DESMOND, We need to get to Jack. We can't let him get in touch with that boat.
DESMOND, What? On the way? No.
DESMOND," No that woman, Naomi, she lied. The people on the boat aren't who they say they are!"
DESMOND," I don't know, but we need to get in touch with Jack, now!!"
DESMOND," Where is it, get it. "
DESMOND,"  I'm, I'm sorry brother. I..."
DESMOND, Well... look at that. 
DESMOND, Hey. I'm gonna ask you one last time. Why was Naomi carrying this picture of me?
DESMOND," Look, Naomi told me you people were hired by her!  So you look me right in the eye and tell me you've never seen or heard of Penelope Widmore."
DESMOND," Fine. You don't want to tell me the truth; I'll find someone who will. See, when that takes off,  I'm on it."
DESMOND, Aye.
DESMOND, Answers. 
DESMOND," I'm sorry, sir. I was...I was having a dream, sir. "
DESMOND," I was in a helicopter, sir. And there was a storm, sir. And I don't remember the rest, sir."
DESMOND," Sorry brother. It's just that, I've never had a dream so vivid. It was like I was actually there. "
DESMOND, Who are you? How do you know my name?!
DESMOND, What am I doing here?!
DESMOND, How do you know my name?!
DESMOND, Let go of me!
DESMOND," Alright, where am I?"
DESMOND," Alright, who are you people?"
DESMOND, What am I doing here? who are you people?
DESMOND, I'm not your friend! I don't know you! I don't know you!
DESMOND," Listen, listen. This is a mistake, alright?"
DESMOND, I don't know these people. 
DESMOND," No, this is wrong! I'm not supposed to be—"
DESMOND, —here!
DESMOND," If I told you, you'd think I was crazy."
DESMOND," This morning, when I was in the yard doing crunches, I left."
DESMOND, I was on a boat. And then I was back here...right where I started. 
DESMOND," Billy, I'm telling you the truth, man."
DESMOND, Penny. There was a photo. Penny was in the photo.
DESMOND, I'm not here. This...this isn't happening.
DESMOND, Wh-wh-what am I doing here?
DESMOND, Who are you people?
DESMOND," What do you mean, sort out? Wait a minute! What do you mean? "
DESMOND, I'm not supposed to be here! 
DESMOND, I'm not supposed to be here! Open this door! Open this door!  
DESMOND, Hey. Hey. Hey! Can you hear me? Are you alright? Hello? 
DESMOND, What the bloody hell is going on?!
DESMOND," You're not going to stick me with that, brother!"
DESMOND, Why?
DESMOND, Desmond.
DESMOND, Penny?
DESMOND," Uh, Penny, listen. I'm in trouble, and I think something's happening to me, and I'm confused, and I need to see you."
DESMOND," No, no, I'm not. It's... look, I've got two days leave starting tonight. Can I...can I come and see you?"
DESMOND, Moved? Where? 
DESMOND," Look, look, now listen, Penny, Penny, I need—"
DESMOND, —need you. 
DESMOND, Hello?
DESMOND, Took off? What?
DESMOND," What do you mean, what year do I think it — it's 1996! "
DESMOND, Um...um...I'm in some kind of sick bay...
DESMOND," Uh, Camp Millar, it's a... Royal Scots Regiment, it's just north of Glasgow. "
DESMOND," What, why?"
DESMOND,  Yes! What've you got?
DESMOND, What?
DESMOND, 2.342 and oscillating at eleven...
DESMOND," Um, sorry. Are you Daniel Faraday?"
DESMOND," Um...sorry, I'm Desmond Hume, and um...I was told I could find you here. I think I've ... just been to the future. "
DESMOND," Yes. Uh, I spoke to you there, you told me to come here, to Oxford, to find you. You said you'd help me. "
DESMOND, Sorry?
DESMOND, Set your device to um... 2.342 and make sure it oscillates at 11. 
DESMOND, You did. 
DESMOND, I know about Eloise.
DESMOND," What, what is all this?"
DESMOND," Actually, um, no. "
DESMOND, Maybe you just forgot. 
DESMOND," So this, this is changing the future?"
DESMOND, What's that for?
DESMOND, Do I get one?
DESMOND, So what do you put on your head?
DESMOND, What does this do?
DESMOND, What happened?
DESMOND," I'm sorry, how is a rat running through a bloody maze so incredible?"
DESMOND," S-so you, you sent her to the future!"
DESMOND," So, so how does that help me?"
DESMOND," I don't know why you sent me here. All I know about you is, you, you end up on some bloody island. "
DESMOND, I need to get back. 
DESMOND," He said he could help me, said he could tell me what I needed to do. "
DESMOND, Do I know you? 
DESMOND, So? What's that got to do with me?
DESMOND, What happened?
DESMOND, Out?
DESMOND, Aye. 
DESMOND, I don't know...five minutes? Why does this keep happening?
DESMOND, What happened to her?
DESMOND," Yeah, I can see that. How?"
DESMOND, Is that going to happen to me?
DESMOND," If these keeps happening, am I gonna die?!"
DESMOND," Wh...what do you mean, anchor?"
DESMOND, This constant — can it be a person?
DESMOND, I'm calling my bloody constant. 
DESMOND, I need to call Penny. 
DESMOND," Listen, brother, I don't know you. But you seem to know me, so...so if you and me are friends, then I need your help. I need to call Penny, now. "
DESMOND," Hey, uh...your nose, brother."
DESMOND," Listen, brother, I just need to speak to that gentleman, just for a moment, okay?"
DESMOND," Just for a minute, alright? Mr. Widmore!"
DESMOND," Can I have a word, sir?"
DESMOND," I need to get in touch with Penny. I don't know how to reach her, and her number's been disconnected. "
DESMOND, Why do you hate me so much?
DESMOND," Hey, how did this happen to you?"
DESMOND, Where is he?
DESMOND," Can you fix it, brother?"
DESMOND," Wake up, wake up, you've got to come back! You've got to come back—"
DESMOND, No.
DESMOND, It's 2004...
DESMOND, The same thing that's gonna happen to me.
DESMOND," I had to... I mean, I tried to call you, but you disconnected your phone. "
DESMOND," Wait a minute, Pen, please wait. I just need to get your new phone number, okay? "
DESMOND," Because I made a huge mistake, I never should have broken up with you, and, and and... and I know that now,  and I'm sorry, and—"
DESMOND," —and I understand. And I know it's... it's too late to change things, but I need to tell you something and, and I need you to listen to me, and I know it's going to sound ridiculous, but... please, Pen. I need you to listen to me. "
DESMOND," I know this doesn't make any sense, because it doesn't make any sense to me. But... eight years from now... I, I need to call you, and I, I can't call you if I don't have your number. "
DESMOND," Look, Penny, just, just give me your number, and, and I, I know I've ruined things, and I know you think things are over between us, but they're not. If there's any part of you that still believes in us, just give me your number."
DESMOND," I won't call for eight years. December 24, 2004. Christmas Eve. I promise. Please, Pen."
DESMOND, Aye. 
DESMOND,  It wouldn't do any good. You have to keep that number. You can't change the—
DESMOND," —just, just remember, December the 24th, 2004. If you still care about me you'll have to—"
DESMOND," I'm not crazy, Penny! You have to believe me! You have to—"
DESMOND, —trust me. 
DESMOND, 7946-0893.  It's a London number. 
DESMOND, I hope so too.
DESMOND, Penny?
DESMOND," Penny...Penny, you answered. You answered, Penny."
DESMOND," I'm... I'm, I'm on a boat. Um... I've been on an island, and— Oh my god, Penny. Is that really you?"
DESMOND, You believe me? You still care about me?
DESMOND," Yes, yes, I'm here! I'm still here, can you hear me? "
DESMOND," I love you, Penny. I've always loved you. I'm so sorry. I love you."
DESMOND," I don't know where I am, but—"
DESMOND, —I promise—
DESMOND, —I'll come back to you—
DESMOND," Thank you, Sayid.  It was enough. "
DESMOND, Aye. I'm perfect. 
DESMOND," Yeah, much better, thanks."
DESMOND, Good morning.
DESMOND, Sayid! What's that?
DESMOND," How long's that gonna go on for, eh? Can't they just fix whatever the bloody hell's causing that?"
DESMOND," What, you think somebody's doing that? Somebody's just banging those pipes again and again?"
DESMOND, Hey! Hey!
DESMOND, That woman just jumped over the side of the ship!
DESMOND, Don't just stand there! What's the matter with you people?!
DESMOND, Why aren't you doing anything?!
DESMOND, Bring a rope!
DESMOND, She just jumped!
DESMOND, What exactly is going on here?
DESMOND, This is Charles Widmore's boat?
DESMOND, This... ship isn't moving.
DESMOND, Desmond.
DESMOND," Hey Sayid, what are you doing?"
DESMOND," Hey, Sayid."
DESMOND, The injured man... there was no gunshot. What do you think happened to him?
DESMOND, I can't go with you.
DESMOND, I've been on that island for three years. I'm never setting foot on it again ... not when Penny's coming for me.
DESMOND," Stay on that bearing, yeah?"
DESMOND, Where's Sayid?
DESMOND, You okay?
DESMOND," Okay, engine should be working."
DESMOND," All right, well, take us to the island."
DESMOND, But make sure you—you stay on the bearing of 3-0-5. It's gotta be exactly 3-0-5. 
DESMOND, RF interference? How is that possible? The radio room's down.
DESMOND, Then I'll find it.
DESMOND, Hey! Michael! I need you now!
DESMOND," There's enough C-4 here to blow up a bloody aircraft carrier. When I was in the army... I did six months' explosive ordnance disposal, which, as the saying goes, is just enough time to learn how to blow yourself up."
DESMOND," This is a—a radio receiver. It's... it's like a walkie-talkie. You send it a signal, and, uh... it—it triggers a bomb remotely."
DESMOND,"  This is a... this is a trip wire. Move it, and... boom. This is dummy wiring. If you cut the wrong one... boom. This is multiple firing systems. You disable one, and the next one... boom. Uh, this... battery's the power source. If you disconnect it—"
DESMOND, You're gonna what? 
DESMOND, And what's the catch?
DESMOND," Well, shouldn't we save it till the light turns red?"
DESMOND," All right, um, freeze the battery. Jin, help me trace back these wires, make a list of where each of them goes to."
DESMOND," I think I might have something. Okay, so... so if... if I cut this wire, it... it should disconnect the firing mechanisms."
DESMOND, Damn it! I—I just don't know enough. H—how do we even know your little freezing trick's doing anything?
DESMOND, How much stuff do we have left?
DESMOND, What happens if we can't deactivate the bomb?
DESMOND," Oh, bloody hell. Don't land! You can't land! Don't land! Don't land! There's a bomb! There's a bomb! Get away! There's a bomb! You can't land! Go back!"
DESMOND, Don't land!
DESMOND," No! Don't land!  No! No! Look, you don't understand! Jin and Michael are doing everything they can, but there's no time! You've gotta get off the boat now!"
DESMOND, Give it to me. I'll do it.
DESMOND, Give me a minute! No! Wait!
DESMOND," Yeah, what is that?"
DESMOND, I think it does!
DESMOND, Penny? Penny! Penny!
DESMOND,  I'm—I'm fine.  I'm fine.  H—how did you find me?
DESMOND," I love you, Penny... and I'll never leave you again."
DESMOND," Uh... this is—this is Penny. This is, um, Kate and then Aaron."
DESMOND," Um... and this is Sun, Sayid, Hurley."
DESMOND," This is Frank. And Jack. Jack, this is—this is Penny."
DESMOND,"  Are you sure about this, brother?"
DESMOND,  As long as I've got Penny... I'll be fine.
DESMOND, Aye. I guess you will.
DESMOND,  Are you him?
DESMOND, My replacement.
DESMOND, Do I know you?
DESMOND, What are you talking about?
DESMOND, What helicopter? What are you talking about?!
DESMOND,  I was on the Island.
DESMOND, I was on the Island.
DESMOND," It wasn't a dream, Pen."
DESMOND, It was a memory.
DESMOND, We're leaving.
DESMOND, Oxford.
DESMOND, Efren Salonga?
DESMOND, Ef—Efren Salonga!
DESMOND, Efren Salonga?
DESMOND, Efren Salonga!
DESMOND, Efren Salonga!
DESMOND, Efren Salonga!
DESMOND, Efren Salonga?
DESMOND, Are you the doctor?
DESMOND," You're sure you know what you're doing, yeah?"
DESMOND," Because there's a lot of blood, man!"
DESMOND," I'm coming, Penny!"
DESMOND," It's okay, Pen. We've got a doctor."
DESMOND," It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Okay, here you go."
DESMOND," Okay. Just breathe, Penny, okay? J—just breathe."
DESMOND, Breathe.
DESMOND, You're doing great.
DESMOND," You're doing great, okay. Okay, just be strong, yeah? Okay."
DESMOND, Just be strong.
DESMOND," Yes, you—yes, you can, Penny."
DESMOND," Okay, push now, Penny. Push. Now!"
DESMOND," Come on, Penny. That's it."
DESMOND," It's coming. Come on, Penny."
DESMOND, I can see the head!
DESMOND, I can see the head!
DESMOND, I can see it. It's just coming.
DESMOND, It's coming! It's coming! You've got it!
DESMOND," Oh my God, Penny."
DESMOND," You did it. Oh, my God, Penny. You did it."
DESMOND,"  I love you, Penny. I love you."
DESMOND," Oh, oh, he's beautiful. Beautiful. Oh, my God. He's so beautiful. Oh, my God."
DESMOND, I love you.
DESMOND, I love you.
DESMOND,  Look. Right out there.
DESMOND," Beyond where you can see, there's—there's an island, and it's a very special island.  I left it a long time ago. I never thought I'd see it again."
DESMOND," It's called Great Britain. And the most beautiful part of the island is Scotland, and that's where your daddy's from. There's mountains and glens and monsters in deep lochs, and... and it's where your mummy and daddy... fell in love."
DESMOND," Yeah, well, I... I thought I'd leave that wee bit out of it."
DESMOND," We'll be in and out. He'll never know we're here, Penny."
DESMOND," But this has nothing to do with your father, Penny. We are here because of Daniel Faraday.  What he told me—that everyone on that island is in danger, and I am the only one that can help them. I have to do this, Penny."
DESMOND, Did he finish his breakfast?
DESMOND,"  Look, honey, all I have to do is find his mother, tell her he's still on the Island, and then I'm done with this for good."
DESMOND," I don't know. Look, I don't understand how any of this works any more than you do. It...  Look, I know it happened. Daniel Faraday knocked on the hatch door and told me to go to Oxford... everyone was in danger, and I was the only one that could save them. I know how insane it sounds."
DESMOND," I'll be back by dark, and then I'm done... forever.  I promise."
DESMOND,  Why in God's name would I ever go back there?
DESMOND," No, that—that's impossible. 'Cause I know her son was a professor here. His name's Daniel Faraday. I'm sure he's in your database."
DESMOND,  I visited him. I went to his lab. It was in an attic. It was...  it was above the physics department.
DESMOND, The year? ...No. I'm not exactly sure.
DESMOND,  Sorry I wasted your time.
DESMOND, No. Not exactly.
DESMOND, So why'd you tell me not to touch it?
DESMOND, You mean Daniel Faraday.
DESMOND, Aye.
DESMOND, Fair enough.
DESMOND, Faraday—the university says there's no record of him.
DESMOND, What girl?
DESMOND," Uh, my name's Desmond Hume. I'm looking for Theresa Spencer."
DESMOND," Oh, right. Um, can I have a word with her?"
DESMOND," Yeah, I got her name from a—a gentleman I met at Oxford University...um... Daniel Faraday."
DESMOND, Thanks.
DESMOND," No. No, he didn't. Can she hear us?"
DESMOND," ""Away""? What do you mean?"
DESMOND," I'm sorry. Um, this was a mistake. I... I shouldn't have come."
DESMOND,  He left her like this?
DESMOND," Uh, I'm sorry. Who?"
DESMOND," I know you have questions for me. I'm not gonna answer them. I've come here to ask you something. And once you've told me everything I need to know, you'll never see me again. Understand?"
DESMOND, I need to know where I can find Daniel Faraday's mother.
DESMOND," Because even before you put Faraday on your little boat and sent him off to the Island, you spent ten years funding his research. So I figure, you must know something regarding his next of kin."
DESMOND, Where's Faraday's mother?
DESMOND, Danger?
DESMOND,  Thanks for the advice.
DESMOND,  Hi.
DESMOND, Good day?
DESMOND," Ugh. There was no one to find. She, um... she died a few years ago."
DESMOND,  What? I'm not.
DESMOND,  She's in Los Angeles.
DESMOND," Look, Pen, you've got nothing to worry about. You know, this was a mistake. No, I... I made a promise that this would be done in a day, and now it's done. It's not our problem anymore."
DESMOND, Then I'll forget it.
DESMOND," I'll forget it. It doesn't matter, Pen. You're my life now—you and Charlie. I won't leave you again... not for this... not for anything."
DESMOND, You're looking for Faraday's mother too?
DESMOND," Um, I'm sorry. Excuse me.  Am I really hearing this? That's what this is about? You're all going back to the Island? Willingly?"
DESMOND,  I came here to deliver a message.  Daniel Faraday—your son—sent me here. He wanted me to tell you that he and all the people on the Island need your help. He said that only you could help them. He didn't say Jack. He didn't say Sun. He didn't say Ben. He said you.
DESMOND,  Consider the message delivered.
DESMOND," This woman cost me four years of my life—four years that I'll never get back because you told me that I was supposed to go to the Island! That it was my bloody purpose!  You listen to me, brother, and you listen carefully.  These people—they're just usin' us. They're playing some kind of game, and we are just the pieces.  Whatever she tells you to do... ignore it.  You say the Island's not done with me? Well, I'm done with the Island."
DESMOND, Hey!  What are you doing here?
DESMOND, Aah!
DESMOND, Hi.
DESMOND," I promised you, Penny.  I promised you...  I'd never leave you again."
DESMOND, Are you a nurse?
DESMOND," What, move me? Move me where? Where's my wife?"
DESMOND, I want to see Penny.
DESMOND,  You.
DESMOND, What happened to me? Where am I?
DESMOND," Yes, I remember. Look I want to talk to Penny. Penny!"
DESMOND, Come with you? Come with you where?
DESMOND," You take me back! You take me back right now, you hear?!"
DESMOND, Hey. What the hell are you doing?
DESMOND, Sacrifice? What the bloody Hell do you know about sacrifice?
DESMOND, Aah! Uhh! Aah!
DESMOND, Let me out!
DESMOND, Let me out you bastards! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! 
DESMOND, Sorry?
DESMOND, Yeah. 
DESMOND, Thank you.
DESMOND," Hang on, I got it, I got it."
DESMOND, Pleasure. You got any more bags?
DESMOND, Boy or a girl?
DESMOND," Oh I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean to pry."
DESMOND," All right. Well you're braver than I, you know. I'm not a big fan of surprises.  Oh excuse me, that's mine."
DESMOND," So, have you got someone meeting you?"
DESMOND," Because I've got a car picking me up. You now, If you need a ride I'd be more than happy to give you a lift."
DESMOND," All right, well, it was nice meeting you. "
DESMOND, A boy.
DESMOND, Bet it's a boy.
DESMOND, Looks like I'm with you.
DESMOND, Thank you. 
DESMOND," Hi, George."
DESMOND, The office.
DESMOND," Yeah, that's right."
DESMOND, I was closing a deal for the boss.
DESMOND," The room service at the hotel's excellent, thank you."
DESMOND, I'm not looking for any companionship. I'm here to work.
DESMOND," Lovely, thank you."
DESMOND, Thank you.
DESMOND, Charles.
DESMOND, Thank you.
DESMOND, Yes. I've heard he's quite talented.
DESMOND," No, can't say I have."
DESMOND, So you want me to babysit him?
DESMOND," Say no more Charles, it's done."
DESMOND," I'm a blessed man, Sir."
DESMOND," That's your sixty-year-old Scotch, Charles."
DESMOND, Slàinte.
DESMOND, That's right.
DESMOND," Good. Mr. Pace, I'm Desmond Hume. Charles Widmore sent me."
DESMOND,  Hey! Where you going?
DESMOND, Hey!
DESMOND,"  I'll have whatever he's having.  One drink, then we go."
DESMOND, No title. Plenty of perks though.
DESMOND, I get to meet charming people.
DESMOND, Quite.
DESMOND," Well, I've got a great job, lots of money, get to travel the world. Why wouldn't I be happy?"
DESMOND, Thousands of times.
DESMOND, I wasn't aware that love looked like anything.
DESMOND," Is that so? Well we were on the same flight, so...maybe I saw it too."
DESMOND, Oh? Enlighten me.
DESMOND, Her?
DESMOND," Well that's just...poetry, brother. You know you should, you should write a song about that."
DESMOND," No, that's not the truth. You want to know the real truth, Pace? Right now you have a choice - you can keep on drinking, or you can come with me. Now before you make your choice, realize that if you stay here, it will very likely result in the extermination of your musical career."
DESMOND," In twenty minutes, you'll be luxuriating in a five-star hotel, right on the harbor front, and Charles Widmore - one of the most powerful men in this town, will owe you a favor."
DESMOND," There's always a choice, brother."
DESMOND," Sure, for what it is."
DESMOND," Why, because none of it's real?"
DESMOND, What's that?
DESMOND, Why in God's name would I want to get out of the car?
DESMOND, Aah! Uhh!
DESMOND,  Charlie! Charlie!  Come on!
DESMOND,  Come on! Come on! Damn it!
DESMOND, Nope.
DESMOND," No. Listen, I need to find the man I was brought in here with."
DESMOND, What do you mean?
DESMOND," Um, I'm not sure."
DESMOND," No, I don't have time for this. I need to find the man I came in here with."
DESMOND, No. Nothing.
DESMOND," Um, just put down my employer, Charles Widmore."
DESMOND, The button?
DESMOND, Hey! Let me out of here.
DESMOND, Hey! Hey!
DESMOND, I need to find the man I came in here with.  I need to find the man I came in here with.
DESMOND, His name is Charlie Pace. He came in an hour ago. He just give me his room number. 
DESMOND," Look, we were in an accident together. I need to see him!"
DESMOND," Hey. Excuse me. Um, were you on the same Oceanic flight um, from Sydney."
DESMOND," Yeah, that's right. Listen. I wonder if you can help me, brother. I need to find someone. He was on our plane. He's somewhere in the hospital."
DESMOND, Why are you running?
DESMOND, Why'd you try and to kill me?
DESMOND, Want to show me something? Show me your hand.
DESMOND, Your hands. Show me your bloody hands now.
DESMOND, Who's Penny?
DESMOND, I didn't feel anything.
DESMOND, All right. Come on. We're leaving.
DESMOND," Hey, where you going?"
DESMOND, Look he escaped. He knocked over a doctor with a bloody crash cart and then ran out of the hospital.
DESMOND," He's a junkie who drove my car into the ocean, Charles. I'm fine, by the way. Thanks for asking."
DESMOND," With all due respect, sir, it's just a bloody concert."
DESMOND, No.
DESMOND, Mrs. Widmore? 
DESMOND, My name is Desmond Hume. I work for your husband.
DESMOND," Well, the feeling is mutual, Mrs. Widmore."
DESMOND, Eloise.
DESMOND," Well, Eloise, uh, I'm deeply sorry but it appears as if, uh, Drive Shaft won't be able to perform alongside your son. And, uh, I take full responsibility--"
DESMOND, Excuse me?
DESMOND, Yeah. You're not angry?
DESMOND, And you.
DESMOND, Have a good evening.
DESMOND," Excuse me. I'm sorry, um, did you just say Penny?"
DESMOND," Um, I work for Mr. Widmore, may I see the list?"
DESMOND," Begging your pardon, I'm entrusted with confidential items every day."
DESMOND," No, I just want to look at one name on that list. And, if for some reason, that's a problem..."
DESMOND," Look, I'm, I'm sorry, if I've overstepped my bounds."
DESMOND, Stop? Stop what?
DESMOND," Do you, do you know what I'm looking for, Mrs. Widmore?"
DESMOND, How do you know what I want?
DESMOND, I need to see that list...or you need to tell me why I can't. 
DESMOND," Ready? Ready, for what?"
DESMOND, Is there any alcohol in this car?
DESMOND," Just drive, George. "
DESMOND, Yes?
DESMOND," Look, uh, Mr. Widmore, um..."
DESMOND," Dan, if this is about Charlie Pace not being able to perform with you, I'm, I'm very sorry."
DESMOND, Excuse me?
DESMOND, So what is it?
DESMOND, So what do they mean?
DESMOND, You wanna set off a nuclear bomb.
DESMOND," Listen, mate, um. I don't know what any of this has to do with me, so..."
DESMOND, I don't know...I don't know what I felt.
DESMOND," That's impossible, because I don't know anything about this woman, I don't know...I don't know where she is. I don't even know if she exists. She's...she's an idea."
DESMOND, Excuse me.
DESMOND, Are you Penny?
DESMOND," Hello, I’m Desmond."
DESMOND, Fine. How long was I unconscious for?
DESMOND," Will you help me up, please."
DESMOND, It's all right. I understand.
DESMOND," I said, I understand."
DESMOND, You told me you brought me here to the island to do something very important.
DESMOND, When do we start?
DESMOND, What do you mean?
DESMOND, A lot can happen in twenty minutes.
DESMOND, Did it?
DESMOND," Aye, of course. Lead the way."
DESMOND, What happened?
DESMOND," Aye, aye you must have."
DESMOND," I-I think we'd have remembered it, if we had. "
DESMOND," Yeah, I'm fine. Hey, listen, um, would you like to go for a coffee?"
DESMOND, I just fainted in front of you. I'd say we're even.
DESMOND, Absolutely.
DESMOND, Okay.
DESMOND," Yes, George, I did. Corner of Melrose and Sweetzer, please."
DESMOND," Actually, there is one thing, George. Can you get me the manifest for my flight from Sydney, Oceanic 815, just the names of the passengers?"
DESMOND, I just need to show them something...
DESMOND, I'm sorry. Have I seen you before?
DESMOND," No, it's not that. Were you on Oceanic flight 815? About a week ago... from Sydney."
DESMOND, So was I.
DESMOND," Listen, you mind if I join you while I wait for my order?"
DESMOND, Ooh... that is a lot of chicken!
DESMOND, Ah! So what's her name?
DESMOND, And you didn't... it didn't go how you hoped?
DESMOND," Well, all women are a little bit crazy, brother..."
DESMOND, Tell me something...did you believe her when she said she knew you?
DESMOND," Now, I say go with your gut. You know, maybe you should... you should try to find out where she thinks she knew you from before you give up on her."
DESMOND," Ah! That's me, brother. Well, uh... it was nice bumpin' into ya."
DESMOND, Hello.
DESMOND," I don't blame him. Although, as I explained to him before he left... I have nowhere to run to, brother."
DESMOND, Not at all.
DESMOND," Considering I was kidnapped, you'd have to ask him."
DESMOND, He threw me into a wood shack and blasted me with a massive amount of electromagnetism. 
DESMOND, Experience.
DESMOND, Of course. You're John Locke.
DESMOND, Three years.
DESMOND, Do you know better?
DESMOND," Well, there's nothing special about me, brother. This island has it in for all of us."
DESMOND, What?
DESMOND, Who's that?
DESMOND, Do you know that boy?
DESMOND, What is it?
DESMOND, You read my mind.
DESMOND, Very old?
DESMOND, That seems like a lot of work just to get some water.
DESMOND, Did they find what they were looking for?
DESMOND, And that's the reason you wanted me to see this?
DESMOND, Excuse me?
DESMOND, What is the point in being afraid?
DESMOND, Aah!
DESMOND, Excuse me?
DESMOND," No. No. I was um, uh, I just moved to the neighborhood, and um, and, uh, I'm looking for a school for my son."
DESMOND, Charlie.
DESMOND," That's great to hear, thanks. Well, it was nice talking to you."
DESMOND," Hey there. How are you? Uh, we met at the airport. The, uh, the baggage claim."
DESMOND," Nice. I'm Desmond. Desmond Hume. Um, I never got your name. Uh...  ""Claire Littleton."" So--So how you doin'?"
DESMOND," Oh, no. I'm sorry. Are you..."
DESMOND," I have a nose for these things. Look, um...excuse me if this sounds a bit personal, but I couldn't help noticing you're going to an adoption agency...alone."
DESMOND," No, I just meant that you should have some--some legal representation."
DESMOND," No, no. But, uh, it just so happens that I'm on my to see one. You know, adoption contracts are complicated; and, you should be careful because you could find yourself in a situation that's irreversible."
DESMOND," Um...I'm--I'm going to 15 as well. Look, this, um, this attorney I'm seeing--she's excellent. Uh, you know, plus, she owes me a favor. So...why don't you just come and meet her? You know, I think she could really help you."
DESMOND," Look, I promise you it won't cost you a cent. Please. It'd be my absolute pleasure."
DESMOND," Great, this way."
DESMOND," Hi. Uh, Desmond Hume to see Miss Verdansky, please."
DESMOND, Great.
DESMOND, You're very welcome.
DESMOND," Ah, Ilana. Uh, Claire, this is Ilana. Ilana, I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Claire Littleton."
DESMOND," I was hoping you'd be able to help her, um..."
DESMOND," No, absolutely fine. Go right ahead. "
DESMOND," So what did he offer ya? If you're gonna shoot me in cold blood, brother...I think I have a right to know what you're getting in exchange for it."
DESMOND, And what did you lose?
DESMOND, And where is she now?
DESMOND, And what makes you think Locke can bring her back?
DESMOND," So, what will you tell her?"
DESMOND, This woman--when she asks you what you did to be with her again...what will you tell her?
DESMOND, Do not get in my way. 
DESMOND," I'm not here to hurt him, I'm here to help him let go."
DESMOND, You wanna know who I am?
DESMOND," Excuse me... Um, I'd like to see a detective, please. "
DESMOND," Um...there was a hit and run a few days ago at Washington Tustin High School and then this morning, one of the teachers there was--was beaten badly by the--by the same suspect."
DESMOND, I'm the suspect.
DESMOND, You're welcome.  Good afternoon.
DESMOND, And how are you doing today?
DESMOND, Think it's time to leave.
DESMOND," I said, I think it's time to leave. You ready to get out of here?"
DESMOND, I ran over a guy in a wheelchair.
DESMOND, All right. I'm crazy. But do you want to get out of here or not?
DESMOND, The driver already knows where to stop. But when that happens you're gonna have to give me your trust. 
DESMOND," That's right? Because after I set you free, I'm gonna ask each of you to do something, and you're gonna have to promise me that you'll do it. So what do you say?"
DESMOND, How about you?
DESMOND," All right, then. "
DESMOND, That's me.
DESMOND, Don't worry. He'll be here.
DESMOND, All right here he comes.
DESMOND, Don't worry about it.
DESMOND," No, she's not ready yet."
DESMOND," All right, good... Um, you know where you're taking them, yeah?"
DESMOND," All right, well, we should get going.  Okay, you're with him, and you're with me."
DESMOND, We... are going to a concert.  Let's go.
DESMOND, Do you need someone to sign for that?
DESMOND," I do indeed, brother."
DESMOND, Or something... Do you mind taking it around the back there?
DESMOND,"  Just around there, thank you."
DESMOND, A man named Christian Shephard.
DESMOND, Seriously.
DESMOND, Not exactly.
DESMOND," No one can tell you why you're here, Kate... Certainly not me."
DESMOND, I'm not talking about the church. I'm talking about here.
DESMOND," My name is Desmond Hume. And even though you don't realize it, I'm your friend. And, as for what I want--I want to leave. "
DESMOND, Let me show you.
DESMOND, Aye. Your camp's a lot nicer than the bottom of a well.
DESMOND," So, Rose, tell me...how long have the two of you been living here?"
DESMOND, What rule is that?
DESMOND, Fair enough.
DESMOND, I want your word. You won't touch them--ever.
DESMOND, Then I'll do what you want.
DESMOND," No. But, I assume it's a place where there's a very bright light."
DESMOND, Oh. Just a hunch.
DESMOND," This doesn't matter, you know."
DESMOND," Him destroying the Island, you destroying him. It doesn't matter. You know, you're gonna lower me into that light, and I'm gonna go somewhere else. A place where we can be with the ones we love, and not have to ever think about this damn Island again. And you know the best part, Jack?"
DESMOND," You're in this place. You know, we sat next to each other on Oceanic 815. It never crashed. We spoke to each other. You seemed happy. You know, maybe I can find a way to bring you there too."
DESMOND, Aye. I go where the light's brightest.
DESMOND," Aye, indeed it is."
DESMOND, You two know each other?
DESMOND, Aah! Aah! Aah! 
DESMOND, Uhh!
DESMOND, No! No!
DESMOND, Perfectly clear. I chose to ignore  you.
DESMOND, We're leaving.
DESMOND, Not with me...no.
DESMOND, Do you understand?
DESMOND, The light... I put it out. It didn't work. I thought I'd leave this place.
DESMOND, I'm still here. You were right Jack.
DESMOND, I have to put it back. It was like a drain.
DESMOND," Jack you can't, even if you turn it back on it'll kill you. It has to be me!"
DESMOND," What about you, Jack?"
